	<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em><font size="2">&quot;In 1942, Danish poet &amp; mathematician Piet
    Hein invented a game now called Hex. Piet invented the game while he was contemplating the
    famous four-color theorem of topology. The theorem, then unproved, is that four colors are
    sufficient to make any map so that no two countries of the same color have a common
    boundary. The game was introduced as the Niels Bohr Institute. The game became popular in
    Denmark under the name Polygon. The game was printed on pads of paper; and sold as a paper
    &amp; pencil game. For months, Danish newspapers ran a series of &quot;Polygon&quot;
    problems. Albert Einstein kept the game on a shelf in his study.&quot;

    from<a href="mailto:lace@cix.compulink.co.uk"> Michael Leigh</a>, to
    equalize the game (he called it <b>Vex</b>):</font> <i><font size="3" face="Arial">We add an additional neutral
    stone, say red, which is given to the second player who has the option to place this
    stone on the board on any empty hex of his choice either before the first player makes his
    initial move or on any subsequent turn in addition to playing his black </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone.&nbsp;Vex is a draw because white can always pretend the neutral

    </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone before the start of the game and then by assuming the
    stone to be black and playing the 'hex' winning strategy cannot be forced to lose either.
    By using a neutral stone and giving the second player the option when to play it we no longer need to 'know' which hexes are winning hexes for the
    first player in order to make the game fair.</font></i></p>
	<p><font face="Arial">In 1995, Michael Howe proposed, on Games Magazine, 
	three variants of Hex:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial"><b>Link</b>: in this game after placing a stone a 
		player may move any number of their stones which form a connected line, 
		in of the directions of that line, up to as many spaces as the size of 
		the group. Opposing stones in smaller groups may be pushed, but cannot 
		be pushed off the board. [so, something similar to Abalone without 
		captures]</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><b>Tack</b>: in this game a group of two or three 
		stones in an adjacent line are captured if the other player places a 
		stone to bracket the line on both ends. The captured stones are replaced 
		by the capturing player's stones. [custodian capture Othello-style]</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><b>Fan</b>: in this game after placement, an 
		optional capturing move is made by moving a piece one space so as to end 
		up adjacent to an opposing stone, or to end up one space away from an 
		opposing stone it started adjacent to, or both.</font></li>
	</ul>

	<p><a href="chameleon"></a><font face="Arial"><b>Chameleon</b> is a Hex variant, where both players may use stones of either 
color to achieve a vertical/horizontal connection, i.e.,&nbsp; one player wins 
if he makes a vertical connection, the other by a horizontal connection. If a 
move makes both connections, wins the mover.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial">Words from Cameron Browne: <i>
Playing Chameleon is a constant tightrope act. In most connection games, each 
player can concentrate fully on pushing their connection as hard as possible. 
However in Chameleon players must keep their connections strong only in their 
direction or risk having them stolen. Players must consider the implications of 
each move very carefully. Chameleon has a similar feel to <a href="Jade.htm">
Jade</a> but with clearer goals.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial">The game was available at gamerz.com, but the link 
	stopped working, so here is the original text:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Courier New"><b>Rules</b><br>
		<br>
		Two players, Vert and Horz, take turns placing either an 'x' piece or an 
		'o' piece on the board.<br>
		<br>
		Vert wins by completing either a chain of 'x' pieces or a chain of 'o' 
		pieces between the top and bottom board edges. Horz wins by completing 
		either a chain of 'x' pieces or a chain of 'o' pieces between the left 
		and right board edges.<br>
		<br>
		If a move results in a connecting chain for both players, then the mover 
		wins. For example:<br>
		<br>
		. . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. . . . . . x<br>
&nbsp;. . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. . . . . x .<br>
&nbsp; . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. . . . x . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; o o o o o o o .&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. . . x . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. . x . . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		. x . . . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . o . . 
		.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x . . . . . .<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horz wins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Vert wins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last mover wins</font></p>
		<p><font face="Courier New"><b>Notes</b><br>
		<br>
		Playing Chameleon is a constant tightrope act. In most connection games, 
		each player can concentrate fully on pushing their connection as hard as 
		possible. However in Chameleon players must keep their connections 
		strong only in their direction or risk having them stolen. Players must 
		consider the implications of each move very carefully.<br>
		<br>
		Chameleon has a similar feel to Jade but with clearer goals.<br>
		<br>
		One of the most interesting aspects of Chameleon is that it inherently 
		solves the first move advantage problem which plagues most connection 
		games. While opening in the centre is a winning move in Hex, it is a 
		death sentence in Chameleon. The first player's best opening move is 
		well away from the centre and any opponent's edge.<br>
		<br>
		Chameleon should be played on larger boards. Games smaller than 10x10 
		tend to degenerate into a race after only a few moves.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Courier New"><b>References and History</b><br>
		<br>
		Chameleon was discovered by Randy Cox in early November 2003, then 
		independently 
		<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.games.abstract/c/TWYO89lLXpE">rediscovered</a> mid November 2003 by Bill Taylor after an 
		idea by Cameron Browne. Interestingly, there is a good reason for the 
		proximity of these independent discoveries, as both were motivated by 
		the upcoming deadline for the 2003 Shared Pieces game design 
		competition.<br>
		<br>
		The game was originally called Goofy Hex then Funky Hex by Randy, but 
		was first made public under the name Chameleon and that has stuck. This 
		name refers to the fact that players tend to change colours based on 
		their environment; the fact that Bill's eyes pop out when he sees a good 
		move has nothing to do with it.<br>
