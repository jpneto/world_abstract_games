Some notes from the <a href="dieter@REM0VESPAMspielstein.de">author</a>: <i>Accasta
is an abstract board game for two players. Influenced by Dr. Emanuel Lasker's Lasca
and Wladyslaw Glinksi's <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/hexagonal.dir/hexagonal.html" target="_blank">Hexagonal
Chess</a>, I tried to achieve a clean and original game using stacks and a
hexagonal board.&nbsp; In spring 1998, after a long time of development, Accasta
was ready to be published on the Web and in the German game inventor's magazine <a href="http://www.spiel-und-autor.de" target="_blank">Spiel
&amp; Autor</a>, Vol.&nbsp;34. Accasta took part in some game design
competitions and was one of the finalists of the Premio Archimede 1998 in Italy.
In 2001 the first version for online play was implemented for <a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/accasta" target="_blank">Richard's
PBeM Server</a></i>. [...] </font><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>In the Pari
variant it is obviously a good strategy to stack one's own pieces - even more as
in the standard game, as it leads not only to more powerful stacks (regarding
multiple moves), but also promotes the moving piece. On the other hand, it is
still true that powerful stacks are in danger to turn into safe stacks
controlled by the opponent.</i></font></p>
