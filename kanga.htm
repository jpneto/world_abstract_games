<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Kanga was invented in 2002 when 
	Tijn van der Zant and Marco Wiering were sick of playing Go and Pente all 
	the time. The question was whether a real cool game could be invented 
	instead. So they thought of many ideas, but most of them did not work out 
	well when playing. Some of them were pretty dull, static. and predicable, 
	and others were always winning for the player who started the game. After 
	some time they thought it would be cool to make a game in which the goal is 
	to make a connected line from one side to the other side. This was the main 
	idea of the game, but some additional rules to make the game more attractive 
	were invented after that. This led finally to the game Kanga. The game of 
	Kanga is really very dynamic, one needs stategic and tactical knowledge to 
	play it, and the game can change very rapidly, thereby making it less dull 
	than most other games. The rules are quite simple, but it still requires a 
	lot of thinking to make the best moves, just like in Go. The name Kanga was 
	discovered, because when the inventors played the first game, a song was 
	playing on the radio with the word Kanga repeated several times. If anyone 
	knows which song it is, please contact
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070206135524/mailto:t@aisland.org">
