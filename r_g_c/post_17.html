The surface equivalence of these three variations of an underlying game
is, of course, not unknown in general. As Bill probably knows, given his
job and position, they are a visible sign of what we might (informally)
call "game isomorphism" (though it may have a different name that I am
unaware of). The terminology I have used (isomorphism) is taken from a
field of mathematics, and, for all its probable deficiencies, the
article from wikipedia probably gives a sense of what is meant by it
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism ). (As an aside, as an
amateur mathematician in this particular area, though more of a
professional in other areas, I often wondered whether "functor" might
also be used in this context, though I think I have used the
conventional term in the sense it has been conventionally used, such
as in describing scientific models of apparent empirical facts, and so
on.)

I've always been interested in these kinds of discovered relationships
between different games in this entire area, and have read about some
of the isomorphisms that work of JH Conway, and material found in the
Winning Ways volumes and its related topics, that I always enjoy
reading. There can obviously be a "depth" to the kind of abstractions
needed to be able to uncover the isomorphisms, and I imagine that the
ones Bill mentions in his message I'm replying to are more towards the
"surface" than some others could be. I'm thinking of another known game
isomorphism.

The unfamiliar game which is an isomorph of a much more
familiar game is the one in which one has two players who alternate in
playing turns. Each turn involves declaring a ordered couple of two
integers selected from the set {1, 2, 3}. The constraint is that once
announced, an ordered couple *cannot* be announced again. The winner is
the one who immediately satisfies one of the following conditions from
the set of ordered couples they have announced:

(a) the same integer occupies the same position in the ordered couple
three times (eg, <1, 2>, <1, 3>, and <1, 1> would win, as would <3, 2>,
<1, 2>, and <2, 2>.)

(b) the sum of the two integers in 3 ordered couples must be 4 (i.e.,
<1, 3>, <2, 2>, and <3, 1> would win)

(c) The player manages to announced the three ordered couples in which
the first element of the couple is the same integer as the second
element (i.e., <1, 1>, <2, 2>, and <3, 3> would win)

Now, the topic I am writing about will have alerted many to try to
search for the more well-known isomorph of this game, but I wonder if
one were not so alerted how readily people would discover what it is.

These two games (one I've given, and one I have not) also are
interesting because one seems trivially easy to play, whereas the other
seems more difficult, unless one knows the trick of "translating", or
mapping (to informally use the corresponding mathematical term) from
the difficult one to the trivially easy one. The difference in ability
to play may be brought about by many things, but one may be a
difference in sheer familiarity. However, as a professional
mathematical psychologist, it is intriguing to me both from a
mathematical modelling point of view, and a psychological view, in
terms of cognitive ability. We get something similar in
Applied Mathematics, I suspect, where I recall it was always tricky to
solve differential equations the way I was taught in secondary school,
but once I had taught myself Laplace Transform Theory (in order to
prove something for my PhD thesis), they became much more easy in
general: so what was difficult in one form was transformed, using
mathematically proven isomorphisms, into another form that was more
easy to solve. In this case, one can almost prove why it might be easy
to solve these in one form and not so easy in another. Most of my
professional theoretical work has been concerned with showing that
theories and models people think are equivalent are, in fact not, or
that theories or models that people have thought were not equivalent,
are in fact equivalent, which highlights the more general problem of
not being able to recognise the isomorphisms, which is a related area.

Going back to abstract games, I recall that a few games that seemed to
be different on the surface were in fact the same (versions of Nim-like
games), as described in the Winning Ways books and the work of JH
Conway.

It seems to me that a lot of good work could be done in trying to
identify more isomorphisms amongst abstract games, though this
will probably require mathematical abilities in order to do it
rigorously and well. But in so doing it, it might lead to a greater
insight into the underlying "root game" or "canonical game" which one
chooses to use as the basic game to illustrate the core game (and the
problem of why one might be chosen to occupy such a role is also
interesting). I know it isn't discovering new games, but it could be
part of this, and I wonder how many people have thought along similar
lines to myself in this respect?

ps: 1. Sorry for the very long message: my first one to this group, and
much better suited here than in the domain of prima-donnas one seems to
have on the usenet group).

2. How many people have now discovered what the much more well-known
isomorph to the game I described above is, and how did they solve the
problem of which one it was, I wonder?

3. Note the extremely lax way in which one might be tempted to point
out the self-reflexive nature of this message: I tried to not be
rigorously mathematical in my description of the relationships between
the games, but I did try to be accurate. So, in one very lax way, I was
trying to produce an isomorph to my dimly perceived mathematical
structure of equivalence between certain games, but it had to be an
isomorph in a form that was more readily understandable by people
without having to know much mathematics.
