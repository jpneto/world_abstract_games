They are really the same game, only on different grids.

Cool games, with a new winning criterion - excellent.

Luigi - I was just wondering if you'd compared Xodd with
(call it, say) Kodd, (for King-connection Xodd), wherein
a group can involve diagonal connections as well?

Did you do any test comparisons? Both connection ideas
have their merits and demerits, I just wondered if you'd
compared them.

Thanks for commenting, Bill. I haven't tested Kodd, but I suspect it
would be too easy to connect groups. Maybe even a trivial win for one
of the players, more or less the same as in a Hex-like game on a
square board with 8-connectivity.

Also, I think it isn't good to have too few groups at the end of the
game, because the better player will have a harder time showing his
superiority. The game becomes more, say, "volatile".

Anyway, if you ever do any "Kodd" tests, I'd love to read what you've
found out.

Maybe; it's interesting to note that kingwise-adjacency allows
both players to have one huge group on the board, and indeed on
smallish boards filled in at random this would be almost certain
to happen! However, the odd-group rule forbids this, so it would
be interesting to see what would happen. It may be that the game
would become one of very local tactics as players tried to make
or prevent tiny isolated groups, around the edges of a giant
2-group ocean. In such a case parity would be king, and the game
might have a similar feel to Dots-&-Boxes where that very feature
is dominant for most of the game.

> Maybe even a trivial win for one of the players,

Possibly, especially if it is too easy to kill isolated groups,
by joining them to the main ocean. It would be nice to find out.

Well, yes, but only if it is really easy to kill isolated bits.

> The game becomes more, say, "volatile".

I would call it volatile only if it turned out EASY to make isolated
groups, as then no-one would have a real idea of the likely parity
till near the end. That sounds a bit like Reversi, to most of us!
And come to think of it, that would likely be the case with your
own Xodd. There, it would be super-easy to lay down large numbers
of easily-kept-isolated groups, and we would have that same
confusion problem - lack of clarity.

Indeed, now that we've chatted, it does sound interesting.
I'll start one up with Joao. At the moment, we've just started
a round of Yodd, and can't yet tell how it's going.

Will keep folk posted!
