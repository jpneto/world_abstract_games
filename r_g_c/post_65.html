Forms is now revised. The game is now more focused and strategic.
Here are the rules:

The game can be played on an m by n board where n is even. The set up
is a full interspersed board, as in the game Clobber.

e.g. a 4 by 4 board:

BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
WBWB

The game is misere rather than regular. As you know, this means that
the last person to move *loses*. This turns out to be crucial to
making Forms work.. You win by forcing your opponent to capture all
of your pieces.

On your turn you can and must do exactly one of the following two
things:

1) capture an adjacent opponent's piece by replacement (You'll note
that this is again the same as Clobber.)

2) execute a "topologically invariant orthogonal slide" to an empty
space. This mouthful is actually an easy concept to grasp
intuitively. It basically means that you slide (via orthogonally
adjacent empty spaces) as far as you want, combining any number of
changes of direction that you want, such that you land on an empty
space. Here's an illustration (E stands for empty space):

WBEE
EBEE
EWEE
BWWE

Among the possible moves, the uppermost black piece may slide to the
lowermost rightmost empty space, resulting in this position:

EEEE
EBEE
EWEE
BWWB

Why the uppermost leftmost white piece is now missing will be
explained shortly.

When executing a type 1 move or a type 2 move, any pieces *of either
or both sides* that are no longer connected to the orthogonally
connected group (as reckoned by pieces of either or both sides) that
the stone involved now belongs to, are removed from the board and are
out of play, being effectively captured. A type 1 move --- an
adjacent replacement capture of an opponent's piece --- can but does
not have to remove an additional piece or pieces of either side. A
type 2 move --- a slide to an empty space --- *must* remove one or
more pieces of either or both sides. In the diagram above where the
black piece has slid to the lowermost rightmost empty space, the
uppermost leftmost white piece is now no longer part of the
orthogonally connected group to which the slid black piece now
belongs. Note that in such a removal (whether by a type 1 move or a
type 2 move) the question of disconnection is reckoned *after* the
move is completed. Temporary disconnection during the move does not
result is removal. For example:

EEEE
EEEE
WWEE
BEEE

Suppose the leftmost white stone slides to the empty space just to the
right of the other white stone. (This results in immediate loss, but
never mind that.) Only the black stone is removed. The other white
stone stays because it was only temporarily disconnected from the
sliding stone during the move. After the move it is still connected
and therefore remains.

If any of you get a chance to try it, please let me know what you
think.

A few questions about the rules, Steve.

> The game can be played on an m by n board where n is even.

Is there any special reason to disallow odd x odd? Other than
ensuring they start with equal numbers, (which doesn't seemm
all that vital from an equalization PoV, given sliding.)

> is a full interspersed board, as in the game Clobber.

Is Clobber just the same game but standard, (non-misere)?

Is regular a bit too boring, or what?
On 4x4 it could still be subtle. I guess on big boards
it could become sudden-death trivial; but maybe it
could still be playable with a no-kill-all rule
(which would become disabled at the very end OC).

> 2) execute a "topologically invariant orthogonal slide"

Seems cumbersome. Why not call it just "a slide"?

That is a really cool capture technique. Well done!

I'm sure we will. Have you played it much yourself?

It strikes me that a winning strategy (at least on large-ish boards)
might be to "try to win", in the sense of killing all one's
opponent's pieces but one, to severely reduce his options.
You yourself would always retain plenty of options, and
this might make it easy for you to find the key move that
suddenly reduces things to one piece each, which is a win for you.

I have heard, for example, that the modern way to play
misere chess is to try to capture ALL BUT ONE of the opposition
player's pieces, that can then be led on a killing mission all
around the board. This may be quite a common theme in misere
games. I gather that Reversi and misere Reversi can look very
similar right up to the last few moves.

Can anyone here report on the misere chess/reversi situations?

In Suicide Checkers, there is an interesting exercise. The first
player keeps all his men. The second player removes all men, just
one on the back row must be left. If the Checkers variant has
backwards capture, that makes it a win for the first player. If
there is no backwards capture, as in English Draughts, some more
rules, like an extra move at move 1 is needed to make it a win for
the first player. He gets to sacrifice all his 12 pieces before his
opponent can get rid of the one man.

That pattern repeats in suicide elimination games. In general, there
seems to be a rule that, if a misÃ¨re game is meaningful (i.e. of a
complexity somilar to that of the original game), then the strategy
of the misÃ¨re game is like that of the original*, unless it is related
to the end of the game. I had a look at what CGT has to say about this,
but so far I could not find anything which yields a more formal
definition of that guideline.

*Applied to Checkers: avoid zugzwang, generally have more pieces

Here is a list with examples:
http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/47480/a-company-of-misere-games

As for Othello: Anti-Othello and Othello have the same strategy,
in general you want to have less pieces than the opponent. This
makes Othello opaque for some. Anti-Othello, on the other hand,
is straightworward in this respect: as you want to have less pieces
at the beginning of the game and less at the end. In Anti-Othello,
however, you avoid taking corners like the plague,, the direct
opposite of gameplay in Othello.

I am not good at Dots and Boxes, but I would like ask interested
players to check, if chains are equally important in misÃ¨re Dots
and Boxes. Secondly, is playing the edge a reasonable option in
the opening of misÃ¨re dots and boxes? I would see the latter as
a wart, but then, here in Germany, Dots and Boxes is played with
the edges filled in right from the beginning of the game.

No special reason.

Revised Forms and Clobber share the same starting set-up and capture-
adjacently-rule. But type 2 moves make the gameplay wildly
different. I suppose it could be considered a variant of Clobber
rather than its own game, but it's a stretch.

My experience with the game so far is that the misere game is much
more exciting. But do you think there would be any advantage to
changing it to regular with a no-kill-all-rule (except at the very
end)? Or is this really just the same as the misere game?

To me "slide" sounds like just a rook move. I think it's best to
describe the type 2 move explicitly. After it's understood, it can
just be referred to as a slide.

Thank you. The previous version of Forms had that capturing mechanism
as well.

I've played it a fair amount, yes. I recommend playing it on a 4x4
board a number of times before moving on to bigger boards.

As you say, maximizing your options relative to your opponent's is the
basic strategy. In Forms that means obtaining and keeping control
over key connections, so that the surviving portion of the board will
always be a position favorable to you.

Thanks for this very interesting information on misere games. I will
have to consider what all this might mean for Forms' strategy.

Here's a sample 4 by 4 game to illustrate the game's mechanics:

BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
WBWB

Black plays c2-d2, resulting in:

BWBW
WBWB
BWEB
WBWB

White plays b4-a4, resulting in:

WEBW
WBWB
BWEB
WBWB

Black plays a2-b2 (threatening b3-a3 immediate mate):

WEBW
WBWB
EBEB
WBWB

White plays a3-b3 to avoid mate (note that the white piece at a4 has
been abandoned/captured):

EEBW
EWWB
EBEB
WBWB

Black plays b1-c1 (note that the white piece at a1 has been abandoned/
captured):

EEBW
EWWB
EBEB
EEBB

White has b3-a2 immediate mate but he doesn't see it. He plays c3-d3
instead (note that the stones at b2 and b3 are abandoned/captured):

EEBW
EEEW
EEEB
EEBB

Black misses d2-d3 immediate mate. He plays d2-c3 instead, which is
almost as good (note that the stones at c1 and d1 are abandoned/
captured):

EEBW
EEBW
EEEE
EEEE

White plays d4-c4:

EEWE
EEBW
EEEE
EEEE

Black plays c3-b4 mate (the stone at d3 is abandoned/captured):

EBWE
EEEE
EEEE
EEEE

Why do you seem to go out of your way to try to break games?
Especially when the evidence for their being solved is so
uncompelling? Run a damn bot if you can't program one or demonstrate
some sort of algorithm stop being so antagonistic.

That was antagonistic?

2 sentences earlier he said:

It seemed a friendly message intended to give useful feedback, not at
all antagonistic.

To me, trying to break a game is no more "antagonistic" than a
software tester trying to find program bugs or a proofreader looking
through text for typos or a cryptographer trying to find flaws in a
cryptography algorithm. If my game (program, text, algorithm,
whatever) has a problem, I'd rather find out sooner than later.

Did you read the thread with the header "Report on Ki"? This seems to
be becoming a pattern. I agree if you have an actual argument for why
a game is broken you should tell the designer posthaste but look it's
like he's grasping at straws. His reasoning for Form's brokenness is
vague, like how misere games SEEM to play out in general and
qualifying all of his statements with phrases like "might" or "strikes
me". I dunno what it is. Maybe Bill is forlorn because he hasn't
designed anything in a long while (been there), maybe he just likes to
play devil's advocate but what it amounts to is antagonism in the
sense that it's almost like jinxing a game, even though it has no
effect on how the game plays, the intent is definitely questionable.
I'll leave it at that.

It looks like a Holy War is coming up. In any case,
I think "breaking games" is a service. As is any
other reasonable work on the strategy of a game.

I am quite annoyed with hit and run game invention
- design is the wrong word - in general. There is
the occasional ruleset which is so cool that it
has mertit on its own. But most of the time it is
not the ruleset, but the gameplay that establishes
the value of a game and that is intrinsically linked
the strategy and other features. In other words, I
expect a game designer to tell me why I should play
his game, and he should give the reasons for that
in terms of gameplay. If not, then he does not care
about his own game - and then, why should I?

This group is for thinking aloud, too. I am aware
of that. And I do not accuse Steven of hit and run
design anyhow. But trying to establish the strategy
of a game - and that includes, if it can be broken -
is still a service.

Forms was loosely inspired by shogi. The game is not won by grinding
things out. You win by maintaining offensive initiative, maneuvering
for the right moment to strike. Because of the drop rule, the king in
shogi is ultimately indefensible. Defensive plays are still useful
--- but only for so long. Shogi gameplay is, more than anything,
about attacking speed. I'm far from being an expert on shogi, but
after years of playing it (as well as shogi variants that have the
drop rule), this is the strong general impression I get.

My hope with Forms was to bring the excitement of a checkmate game
(and shogi's high excitement in particular) to a game of elimination.
Again, you win not by grinding things out but by attacking faster than
your opponent does. Defensive plays only stem the tide of your
opponent's attack long enough to maneuver for a successful attack
yourself. In Forms any opponent's piece or group of pieces can be
considered a "king" and a target for checkmate. At least it was my
hope to create this feel.

If you guys get a chance to play it a few times on a 4 by 4 board, I'd
be interested to know what your comments and impressions are.

Pointing out potential flaws is a good thing, as long as it's done in
a spirit of helpfulness, and even if the point is vague (of course
specificity is better, but not required).

Games are like scientific hypotheses: you find the good ones by
