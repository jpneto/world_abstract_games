Well, the deadline for the flipping-game contest has come and gone
without a single vote received. Probably my fault. It appears nobody
wanted or had time to play the games. Unless anyone has an idea for
salvaging the contest, I'm inclined to declare that we're all
winners... because that's what worked in preschool.

Well, I have been out of action since the deadline, and will not be in a
position to even try out any of the games for another two weeks (long
complicated story). However, if anyone tried my submission (Mortars) and
has any comments, I'd welcome them because that was the first game I
have ever "invented", and when I got the basic idea for it, I saw that a
whole family of games suddenly became possible at the same time. I chose
the one that seemed easiest to describe, though I found a greater
drawing towards the Screens variant (as it is more wide-ranging and
possibly surprising in its effects as I conceived them to be.)

So, as a newbie at this sort of stuff, I was hoping for any kind of
criticism (such as the rules being too long and complicated, or the game
being too complicated, or both).

I've played about half the games, but it was hard getting matches. I
wanted to play them all, but it was not feasible.

Kitaran is obviously the best out of the bunch. It scales nicely, is
balanced, has great clarity, balances strategy and tactics equally,
and the infinite problem turned out to be an illusion.

Deadcell was my favorite of the rest that I played. A fun little brawl
with what felt like a lot of potential.

Pilf was quite fun. Lots of securing territory then invading. It felt
very similar to Hexxagon, though.

Arrello was colder than a minesota winter. Not something I'm fond of,
but cold games seem popular around these parts. The strategy of trying
to secure lines is a fun one, trying to secure parity isn't so fun.
Bonus points for being really clear, though.

Verto kind of made me angry, I felt like I had very little choice in
what I could do, and even with the placement restriction it felt too
easy to clump up in the center.

Implo took too long, we did not finish on the 9x9 board. I can't
believe the instructions suggest 19x19.

I'm sorry I couldn't play the rest of the games.

I don't blame you. I have always thought sitting down and actually
studying a game intently (let alone ten, and someone else's at that)
is more work than coming up with a plausible game idea.

Perhaps you should have been more clear that doing the evaluation part
was a requirement to submitting a game to the competition - because
then you'd have less games, and it would be more feasible to play them
all.

Kudos to Tristan for making a good effort!

I am sincerely sorry to everyone for not posting in so long. I'm also
sorry how your contest turned out Nick. I nearly played all the
entries all I had left was Mortars and Implo. You can blame the
restrictions on me. When I was planning to enter I thought that having
games with different objectives would be hard to compare. Also the
sandbox seemed like a good system to test the games with and I figured
that entries not play-testable in it would be ignored for the most
part anyway. All in all and I mean not to offend, I think the quality
of the entries was rather mediocre which may have something to do with
the poor turn out but let's face it, people are pretty lazy. I suspect
the spite contest (just kidding) at Rec.games.abstract will fair
better with all its star power although I don't see any standout
entries for it either. Monkey Queen looked good but since its original
conception it has since turned into an all-out tweakfest, something
you'd expect especially Steere to avoid. My possible entry seems
rather strong in comparison although I have some work to do on it yet.
I am quite suspicious of Mark's motives in pressing me to enter
something in the stacking game contest. While he drew me in with chum-
talk about the prestige of winning the contest I can't help but feel
he just wants me to enter the contest thus causing me to concede that
Rec.games.abstract is a valuable and functional forum on which to
discuss abstract games. While I'm not entirely convinced of this Mark
certainly has reduced the frequency of his rants, which used to be a
daily affair. Ultimately I am entering the stacking contest because it
has given me the impetus to flesh out a concept I came up with 5
months ago.

You're absolutely right. I underestimated the stone recycling ratio. I
knew the longest game could be very long, but didn't suspect that
normal games could be soooo long. I guess the standard board could be
7x7 to 9x9. May I ask how many moves per side did you play on that 9x9
game?

Anyway, I have an improvement on this game, which I will make public
when the contest is ended so that it doesn't confuse the voters (if
any :-) ). It's a little rule change, but I think the strategic
component of the game will be fairly improved.

On the absence-of-voters problem, I would've been glad to try the
games, but as I told Nick, I don't have access to the Internet at home
right now, so it's complicated. I hope people gets interested so that
we can finally have a winner.

40 moves each, then my friend had to leave. We had 12 kings on the
board at that point, and very few pawns, so there was still a very
long way to go.

I'm still willing to finish testing and submit my votes, if Nick will
accept them, but I believe the way the rules are, if I voted that
would virtually guarantee Kitaran would not win (since I can't vote
for it.)

OK, maybe 7x7 is a more apropriate board size, then.
