    My first attempt to post thread had two errors in it, and in trying to
fix it I messed up the original thread (why are these forums so
abjectly terrible?). Please refer to this thread from now on since
the older one has one incorrect link to an outdated version of one of
the games.

Below are links to all the games submitted to the contest.

Notes:

Even if you've already read the rules for a given game, read them
again before playing, as designers may have tweaked their rules since
you last read them.

To be an eligible voter, you must a) be a member of this forum; and b)
play each of the contest entries in the "sandbox" at

http://www.iggamecenter.com/

There are three reasons voters must play at the ig game center:
--Arty Sandler has graciously offered to implement the winning game as
a prize, so the least we can do it go drive up traffic at his site.
--It'll make it easier to find opponents for playtesting if we all
test there.
--It'll make it easier to make sure voters have played all the games.
Speaking of which:

Please take a screenshot of each game you play. If some voter is
accused of not having played all the games, I'll ask the accused to
produce screenshots, in case the games in question are no longer in
the iggamecenter's memory banks.

There will now be a two-week evaluation period (Dec 24 to Jan 6),
during which voters will have a chance to play the submitted games.

Votes are due on or before Jan 6, 2011

To vote, each voter will provide a list of the games ordered by
preference, from most preferred to least preferred. The winner will
be determined by an instant runoff

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting

A designer's vote for his own game will not count.

To voters: please send your votes to nickobento [at] gmail.com, with
"my vote" in the subject line.

Your vote should be a ranked list of all the games, with your favorite
game at the top and your least favorite at the bottom

I'll announce the winner on January 7, 2011

Finally, would anyone mind if I published the list of contest entrants
over at BGG with a request to come play them at the iggc sandbox?
(another good thing we can do for Arty)

This is certainly a good idea. :-)

Is there any particular reason you prefer Instant Runoff to Condorcet?
