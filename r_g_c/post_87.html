It doesn't seem to have appeared here before,
but it's very worthwhile. Phil Carmody wrote:

Has it been suggested before? Like reversi, except that you
flip over sequences of both your opponent's colour and the
neutral ones. The latter turn to your own colour, the former,
to neutral.

Quick implementation here:
http://87.119.183.129/perl/Preversi/PreversiCgi.pl?action=newgame
(The reversi engine it's based on is pretty poor and buggy, but
I've fixed it up enough that if you click randomly you might lose.

It looks like a very good game to me. It smooths out
the huge point-count swings present in the basic game,
(that will be either a plus or minus depending on you PoV),
and otherwise seems to have very similar tactics & strategy.

The implementation is also very cool, and fairly intelligent
as a computer player.

I congratulate Phil and recommend the game!

It is not a new variant. Its first name, afaict, is Desdemona and
here's an implementation for Zillions:

Quite right. This has been brought to my attention otherwise.
Silly me.
