Popping in to declare:

1) Good idea, Corey; thanks for taking the responsibility of
moderating.

2) I'm excited about the prospect of thoughtful, non-hyperbolic, troll-
free discussion here. I'm going to go home tonight and test a new
game just so I can post here and get real feedback.

May you all remain young and good-looking.

I too add in my good wishes, and heartfelt thanks.

BTW, Corey-Jack, you may now please ignore my complaints about not being
able to get here - it seemed to be a problem with our work computer,
my home computer is doing it fine!

To make this work, we need as many folk here as possible.
To this end, I would like to advertise it a little, from time to time, on r.g.a.
Would that be OK with you, Corey? And if so, then to THAT end,
how can a member of the public most easily get on/get an invite?
There should be some quick way they can just log-in, get a quick
vetting by you, and have their first posts recorded. It would also
be a good idea if members of the public could READ the group
instantly and without vetting of any sort.

Is there any chance of all that being available?

In the meantime, to get things spinning on with some actual games,
here is one that Joao and I came up with.
I include a partially-played example as illustration.
It appears to be the 8th instance we played.
I seem to have won the first 7!

If anyone wishes to challenge me (the world champ!) by email, please do so. :)
(The board needn't be as big, OC, to start with.)

SWEETHEART Y [B:7] game 8
============
Y, with the following modifier.

On each turn the player plays a stone of his own, then (if possible)
an opponent stone next to one of the opponent's last-played stones,
then a stone of his own under group restriction.
First turn is one stone only (no swap).

___________________________________________

Sorry for the board being squashed-up sideways - the usual mailer problem.

Joao and I play a number of such move-modifiers.
The "group restriction" referred to in the rules, means that the two friendly
stones played in your turn must finish up in different connected-groups,
a single stone also counting as a group, OC.

This "Sweetheart Modifier" was one of our funnest ideas, though we
haven't as yet extended it to many other games. The field is open!

I agree that we need as many members as we can get. There are still
some hold-outs. Michael Howe for instance has a personal grudge
against me for calling him Steere's hand-puppet. Understandable but no
need to boycott this site. The best thing anyone who is currently a
member of this site can do is to not post anything game-related on
rec.games.abstract. That site needs to be completely deserted before
we can build anew. I don't discourage anyone from spamming
rec.games.abstract or trolling Steere, activities which I will
continue to engage in, hehe. I'll give you the go-ahead to advertise
the site but I think I got all the active posters from
rec.games.abstract.

Yes, this is all stuff I have to figure out now. I'm trying to
determine how I am going to organize the site but I was busy these
past few days looking for potential members and making sure everybody
made it here okay. I still have 10 outstanding invites that have yet
to be accepted! *gasp*. I've invited members from other forums like
the Yahoo abstracts group and BGG but most of them haven't made it
here yet.

Sweetheart Y is looks neat. Interestingly, as I recall, Matteo
Perilini was messing around with a concept he called Hexxeh that
sounds very similar. Hexxeh combined a game of Misere Hex and a game
of normal Hex. Fairly simple compared to this but it just goes to show
that great minds think alike :D. I'm guessing that this game's point
was to improve on the parity of Y by introducing a cold element?

Bill, I hate to say it, but the diagram you made is practically
indecipherable! Maybe try some other method of making diagrams. I'll
probably be using Google Docs myself. I used the "show original"
option but there was still text interspersed with bits of the
diagram.

Not quite.
We need to post titbits there, of the type that announces
a new game, but gives no details of rules or diagrams or play,
except the most general sort that says what type of game it is -
altogether about half a paragraph; AND says that full details and
discussion are on the recre-site. I think that is the way to get
most people out of rga.

> That site needs to be completely deserted before we can build anew

I don't think rga is ever going to be clean - steere will haunt it
for ever, checking in once in a while to make sure nothing
gets past him. That guy is one sad cookie!

> I don't discourage anyone from ... trolling Steere,

It is my goal in life now.

> I'll give you the go-ahead to advertise the site

Sorry, confused - do you mean you are NOW giving us leave,
or are you saying that you soon will be? And how
should we refer to it; and what links will
most easily allow newbies to join?

> but I think I got all the active posters from rec.games.abstract.

I hope so!

> I've invited members from other forums like the Yahoo abstracts group and BGG

Good. Sterling work!

> Sweetheart Y is looks neat.

Thanks. As I said, the sweetheart modifier (invented by Joao)
can apply to almost any game, with suitable modifications.
For example, one could even do it with chess - at each turn, you make
a move of your own, make a move with the opponent's last-moved piece
(if possible, else pass), then another move of your own, perhaps
under the restriction that it cannot be the same piece as your first
move of that turn. Actually - that sounds cool already!
Must get Joao to give it a try!

One nice thing about the sweetheart idea is that the final game
record will usually look exactly like a regular game -
just with weird play!

> Hexxeh combined a game of Misere Hex and a game

BTW - is Misere Hex any good? Anyone ever played it? It sounds
like it would be scorchingly dependent on parity - a bit CGT-like.

> Bill, I hate to say it, but the diagram you made is practically
> indecipherable!

I know I know! It's bloody Usenet - it used to work on fixed length
font, and I had a huge library of pictures and diagrams that I could
cut-&-paste. But then it changed to variable width and they are all
useless now! I can still use them for email, OC.

I can't even modify them on screen too well, as there isn't a perfect
match between what you see and what you get now! Dammit!!

I'll see what I can do.
Let me just practise here and see what happens...

Does that come out I wonder...?...

interesting idea, to wet people's appetites. It's up to everybody's
individual discretion though. I personally think keeping that site
free of games discussion is the best idea.

Oh of course Steere will remain, but a lone poster talking to himself
is my idea of deserted.

I'm just saying I don't need to have control over everyone. If you
want to advertise this site elsewhere that's your choice. I'm just a
bit dubious about how effective advertising in rec.games.abstract will
be.

I played many games of Misere Hex at iggamecenter. At first it seemed
like a really interesting game but after 20 or so matches my
impression is that it has a distinct lack of clarity and there doesn't
seem to be any tangible way of securing an advantage. The strategies
are that of an inverted Hex though, avoid creating bridges, play from
the edge inward. The problem is definitely a lack of clarity, which
can be expected, given that Hex involves a lot of reading ahead. All
of a sudden you have to consider all the possible ways to avoid
connection instead of the few ways you will be able to achieve it.
Another annoying thing is the inevitable Nim situations, where both
players will waste moves trying to avoid playing particular cells.
These become more and more frequent with greater skill. I don't find
that sort of gameplay very fun myself.

Thanks Corey for mentioning Hexxeh. :)

Bill, your game sounds interesting. Could you open a proper topic for
discussing it?

"Combinatorial Game Thgeory", Conway style, a la "Winning Ways"

A fascinating study, but more a topic in math than a real abstract-game
concept. I too find them rather boring to play, though very intriguing
to analyse.
