REPORT ON "KI"

This is a play-tester's report on KI, which was introduced here
some little while ago. Joao and I have played a few games
of this, and have found it to be broken, sadly.

It seems to have been designed with a view to making a Go-like
game, and initially it seemed to have succeeded. The board is
standard square, and the playing of pieces as in Go,
with these being the key rules of difference:

========================================
A player controls a space when he owns a majority of the stones
orthogonally adjacent to the space, with a minimum of two.
If the space is occupied by his opponent, the enemy stone
is removed from play.

If a space is surrounded by an equal number of stones of
both colors, it is a legal placement for either player.

It is forbidden for a player to place a stone on a space
controlled by his opponent, even to make a capture.
========================================

Alas, we eventually discovered that these rules allow that
square patterns like this...
. . . .
. o o .
. o o .
. . . . are completely untouchable!

Quite un-Go-like, and in any event rather game-crippling;
as it is almost impossible for black to stop white doing this
in any internal space that is about 5x5 in size, perhaps smaller.

To me, this vulnerability of large groups destroys whatever
interest the game might have had. As I say, this is a pity,
as it seemed like a good idea to begin with.

Again, this is largely a matter of taste, and it may be that
it is still an interesting game on small boards, perhaps 9x9.

BIll I have considered this, Ki certainly does need a sizable board to
have any kind of merit but it is not fundamentally flawed, although
obviously it doesn't have the greatest parity because it is has no
coldness. The thing is one has to reconcile creating secure structures
with generating influence over the board. Focussing in on attempting
to create these squares during the game is a good way to lose because
in the meantime the opponent will be creating structures that while
not as secure, create a larger territorial advantage. When Ki is
played on an 11x11 board it can be deceptively deep. The strategy for
winning Ki is to spread your resources out as thin as possible to
create more influence over the board without losing significant plots
of territory. An experienced Go player on iggc who ultimately
convinced me to release Ki, tuerda, demonstrated that sacrifices are
an important strategic device in Ki. Well whatever he was doing it
allowed him to win on a fairly consistent basis playing second. It was
also tuerda who was the first to mention that the gameplay was very
similar to that of Go. All this said, Ki is the simplest application
of a new capture mechanism, it is completely hot and there is an
obvious first move advantage and therefore I wouldn't be surprised if
it could be easily solved however it is really a concept game. The
Reason I released Ki is because it is a game at all, which is
surprising given the minimal ruleset and fundamental hotness. I was
just planting my flag in some undiscovered territory here. I wouldn't
even want to see Ki implemented on any game sites at least until
extensive analysis and play testing was done. As for this unassailable
formation of stones being Un-Go-Like are you aware of groups with 2
eyes in Go? How is this any different? Besides if unassailable
formations didn't exist Ki would be cylcic. But thanks for taking an
interest.

So often, someone finds a dominant tactic in a game and says "well,
that about wraps it up for that game." It's so common there's a name
for it, First-Order Optimal strategy. (FOO strategy)

FOO strategies are easy to hold up as an excuse not to play a game,
but they almost always have counter-strategies that are less obvious.
Think of the chain-rule in Dots, a classic FOO strategy that seems
airtight until the first time you get nibbled.

Go of course has the checkerboard strategy, which can similarly be
beaten by spreading out across the board and securing larger
territories. Almost every game has FOO strategies that turn out not to
be broken after all.
