Reposted from my blog: http://nickbentley.posterous.com/ketchup-30

I lately discovered how to make Ketchup, one of my best games, better.
So now I'm posting my second major revision in as many years. First
I'll describe the new rules, such as they are, and then discuss why
Ketchup warms my pants and why I'm so happy about the new version.
Here we go:

Ketchup is a game for 2 players played with red and green stones on a
hexhex5 board.

Terminology
*Group - a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board.
*Group Size - the number of stones that a group contains. The smallest
possible group has a size of 1.
*To Drop - to place a stone on any empty space.

Rules
*The board begins empty. One player owns the red stones and the other
owns the green stones.
*Red begins by dropping a single stone.
*Then, starting with Green, the players take turns. On his turn, a
player drops 2 stones.
*When a group of at least size 2 has formed, the nature of the turns
change. From then on, on your turn, if your largest group is smaller
than your opponentâ€™s largest group, you must drop 3 stones. Otherwise
you must drop 2 stones.
*The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest
group wins. If the playersâ€™ largest groups are the same size, compare
their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which
aren't the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.

Note
*Record the size of each playerâ€™s largest groups on a sheet of paper,
as theyâ€™re formed. This will make it easier to think. A PDF is
provided at the link at the top of this post, for paper and pencil
play; it contains scoring columns where players can mark their largest
groups.

What's the big deal?
If you're not me, maybe nothing, but I'm me so here I go
pontificating. Ketchup was one of my better games even in its earlier
incarnations. I was trying to design a game which is short,
intuitive, unintimidating, addictive and deep. The difficulty with
these criteria is that the last one is often in conflict with the
first four. Deep games tend to be hard to figure out, and that
quality can make them intimidating and not-addictive. But Ketchup
avoids that trade-off better than most of my other games. There are
two key reasons for this I think:

*Negative Feedback: the leading player plays fewer stones than the
trailing player. If players play quasi-randomly, as new players tend
to do, the game often turns into a nail-biter because the trailing
player tends to catch up. Mind you, because this is a perfect
information game, it's not true negative feedback in the sense that it
makes a weak player stronger. In fact, the main strategic dilemma of
the game is in deciding when to take the lead and when to fall back,
and skill and experience count for everything.

*New players start having strategic ideas quickly. The reason this
happens is that the win condition, "build the biggest group", has a
natural, intuitive quality that our brains can easily generate
thoughts around. So interesting ideas come easily. Importantly, these
ideas are interesting even though they're nowhere near the final word
on good play. The game is indeed pretty deep, and with practice you
realize your initial ideas were wrong and you discard them for
others. I've come to see this dynamic as key to creating games which
are both deep and fun: you must be able to think of exciting
possibilities right when you start playing (because that's fun), and
yet those ideas must turn out to be wrong (because that's deep).

But why did you change the rules?
The last incarnation of Ketchup had a niggling issue which had irked
me for a year. There was a rule prohibiting the players' largest
groups from being the same size at any time during the game. The rule
existed to ensure that the game would never end in a tie, but it
created situations where certain moves were illegal. These
restrictions were an extra cognitive burden that broke the flow of
play without contributing to quality of play. So I started thinking
about how to avoid them. After a while, I discovered a win condition
that avoids ties more naturally, and which allowed me to drop the move
restrictions. Two unexpected and happy byproducts of the new win
condition was that it shortened the rules about about 20%, made them
more intuitive, and I daresay made the game deeper without making it
more intimidating or less fun.

My rule is: if at the end of the game, the players' largest groups are
the same size, you compare their second largest groups to see whose is
bigger, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren't the same
size. The player with the larger of the two wins. The cool thing
about this rule is that, as long as there are an odd number of spaces
on the board, there can never be a tie. In a list of the players'
groups, ordered by size, you will always find at least one mismatched
pair. I love that.

Another thing I love about this rule is that if you have two players
of equal skill, it won't be extremely uncommon for the players'
largest groups to be the same size at the end of the game. The new
rule creates a whole new subgame in this situation where the players'
second- and third- largest groups matter. So you have to "play the
whole board" more in order to win in those situations. But this only
happens in *very* tense games that go neck and neck to the end. So
this new subgame comes up only when you're already having a riveting
experience. That's a perfect time for extra depth to rear it's
head.

But: I reserve the right to be wrong about everything. That's the
delight and frustration of abstract games - they try to hide their
true nature from you.

Hi Nick - very interested in-DEED to hear of your changes,
as they follow very closely to what Joao and I have been playing
for a little while, based on Ketchup, and which we called SAUCE.

We also picked 5-hexhex, though I note it is quite a nontrivial

Yep. 12* - standard equalizer for 2-move games.

Very neatly worded.

This is the point where we didn't fully change it, but I see your
new rule is both more natural, less restrictive, and thus better.
We still used the "not-equal-sizes" rule; but your reasons given
below are very good. We will soon change, I'm sure!

> What's the big deal?

A very big deal indeed. Our sauce is already fun to play,
but the new ketchup/sauce is even better. It is a really good game
and seems almost like an other-civilizations-too game - very natural.

All achieved; well done.

I'm a HUGE fan of the negative-feedback effect in games,
as you may know. It never actually occurred to me before,
but ketchup is indeed a good example of the effect.

A very astute summary, and may go some way towards a final
determination
of just what makes a game "deep".

All very good. I really like the new no-restriction rule.
And, of course, it's always a big plus if some desired effect comes
out of the simplest rules, rather than having to be artificially
wedged into the rules themselves. And this is the case here.

Yes, we've been using this criterion in many similar games. It's
good.

That is indeed a very cool feature!!

Yes, this has never happened yet with Joao and myself, but I see
by looking at a few 3hexhex jousts playing against myself,  that
it can be quite common there! Neat.

IMHO you're dead right about everything. You deserve some sort
of prize for discovering this game! :-)

Another astute comment!

Keep up the good work, Nick.

You can't mention SAUCE and then not tell us the rules! That's cruel.

I'd like to play some more on hexhex4 before declaring that hexhex5 is
the best for this version. One thing I'm pretty sure of is that the
game suffers on boards larger than hexhex5.

Wow, thanks. Although I have been tinkering with it for two years, so
it doesn't exactly feel "discovered" from my point of view.

Your enthusiasm for negative feedback has rubbed off. I've tried to
design a whole bunch with it. Though it's turned out to be more
difficult to use well than I'd hoped. The feedback can't be too
strong or too weak and finding a set of rules that gets it right can
be daunting. Also, the "power" of the feedback can change throughout
the game, which can lead to situations where even if the feedback is
the right strength at some points during a game, it because too strong
or too weak as the game progresses, and leads to boring choices.

Incidentally, I think GO is a good illustrative example: when you
first learn Go, all you can think about is trying to aggressively
capture your opponent's groups...until you meet an opponent who lets
you capture in exchange for positional advantage, and crushes you.
Capturing aggressively right away is fun but also wrong.

Any whose rules you'd care to divulge here?

On hexhex5 with the current rules, it happens to me about 10%-20% of
the time, but that's a very rough estimate based on a small sample.
Also, the frequency may go up or down with experience.

I'll take it :)

Well, I more or less did! It's your latest version, but also
retaining the no-equal-sizes rule. I didn't write it in full
because I immediately saw your latest version was better.

But you can keep the name "Sauce" if you like! :-)
Or possibly "Chutney". ;-)

Sensible.

What is the nature of the suffering? Is it merely that with
so much space the whole thing becomes little more than a counting
exercise, to determine the mathematically perfect "join-up" time?
Or is there some other feature? Certainly I can see that if it is
the former, it would remove the geometry of the game, rendering it
rather sterile.

> > and seems almost like an other-civilizations-too game - very natural.

I'm quite serious about this. It joins with Go, Hex, Y, and a few
others, that just seem to flow naturally from a single basic idea.

OC - saying "discovery" is just an in joke with me and Joao.
I mean no insult to someone who feels he has been "constructing"
like billy-oh!

> Your enthusiasm for negative feedback has rubbed off.

Glad to hear it! I remain convinced it is a great criterion.
Though I can see that the general public might prefer games that
have an avalanche of increasing domination once some floodgate
has been broken. I suppose both sorts are worth their value.

> I've tried to design a whole bunch with it.

Now that you say that, it seems I recall your saying it before.
If the basic forms are still on the secret list, you could write
to me privately, to see if I can help out with the designs.

>  The feedback can't be too strong or too weak

Quite so.

> and finding a set of rules that gets it right can be daunting.

And OC it's always better if the feedback isn't blatantly visible
in the rules, but rather flows from them naturally. (This is why
I like the "Beat-It-Or_eat-It" game I described in rga long ago.)
If Ketchup/Sauce has a tiny fault, it is that - the benefit
to the behind-player is pretty blatant! But no matter.

Incidentally I experimented with 3 vs 4 stones, rather than
2 vs 3; but 2/3 seems better, as well as simpler.

Yes, I can see that could be a major problem. One can only hope
to get it right for the longest part of the game, and let the others
fall out as they may.

A player must go through many levels with many changes of mind,
before getting near the top. And OC, the things learned earlier
must still be kept for later, to be used when appropriate!
Go is supreme at this; though "Reversi" also has this feature.
The only trouble with Reversi is, no matter what I learn about it,
it still seems to be almost entirely random! :-(

> > Yes, we've been using this criterion in many similar games.

No secrets, and I think Joao has most of them on his web-site.
But I generally prefer to have a game well-tested, before publicizing
it in newsgroups. But there will be some soon.

Ah. I see. It's cool that we were going in the same direction. Great
minds blah blah blah.

The reason it suffers on boards larger than hexhex5 is the same for my
suspecting that it will be best on hexhex4. The rule change reduces by
a little the incentive to take the lead, and so pushes the lead-
changing portion of the game back. The reason it does this is that in
the old version, you created illegal moves for your opponent when you
took the lead, but in the new version you don't. In consequence, the
opening phase of the game where neither player particularly wants the
lead lasts a little longer. On big boards, it's too long for me.

Incidentally, I just posted a new, related game that was partly a
response to this issue:
http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-clots

I will at some point. Joao has roped me back into thinking about games
nonstop and I'm trying to put some limits on it. But part of my being
roped-in involves some PBEM play of two negative-feedback n-in-a-row
games, where you're penalized a bit when you build a row which is
longer than any constructed prior to that point. I wrote about them
here:

http://nickbentley.posterous.com/two-attempts-at-a-more-strategic-n-in-a-row-g

The first of them, Hedgerow, had way-too-strong negative feedback
under the rules at the link above, but Joao has since come up with a
really novel idea that seems, so far, to make it work. The second
game, Morro you might like more, in particular because the negative
feedback is subtle/ not-immediately obvious. That one seems to work
well with the rules as originally written.

I waffle about this issue. If obvious negative feedback helps a new
player to generate ideas for play that excite her, then sometimes I'm
for obviousness. But I definitely sympathize with the "natural flow"
idea. p.s. Beat-It-Or-Eat-It is awesome. You should post it here for
posterity.

Me too. Same conclusion.

Heh. Reversi is your whipping post it seems.

But I thought you were playing with the no-equal-groups rule! How
could you have seen it when largest groups can never be the same size?
Do you mean you haven't seen it in other games with the same win
condition? If so, did those games have negative feedback?

It is nearly identical to a Russian game, Svoyi Koziri.
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=svoyi+koziri

My limited experience with BIOEI was that it felt incomplete as a
game, and seeing the more fleshed out rules on wiki gives me an idea
as to why.

Too kind.

Maybe some time.

Yes, I first learnt it from a Russian emigree to England.
That version is in turn based on a Russian peasant game,
which has the same basic idea but endless horrible
excrescences, as traditional peasant ganmes tend to do.
(In particular, Skat and Duplekopf are truly revolting
games, like Western Mah-Jong.)

My version is a still further purification that does away
with specialized trump suits. I used to like the effect
of trumps too, but eventually came to realize that most
of them were present in the pure (no-trump) game anyway.

Interesting how it's different strokes for different folks,
as always. My taste is *always* for "purification" in games.
I vastly prefer it when fancy effects flow out from simple rules,
rather than have them "built into" the rules themselves.

OC folks' mileages will vary...

Bill,

Your question about why I feel Ketchup may need a smaller board got me
thinking about the negative feedback. In particular, how it's a bit
too strong early. And after thinking about it all day, it occurred to
me that there may be yet another improvement to be made. Consider the
following rules:

1. The board begins empty. One player owns the red stones and the
other owns the green stones.
2. Red begins by dropping a single stone
3. From then on, starting with Green, each player drops two stones on
her turn.
4. If, on your turn, you create or extend a group larger than any
other on the board, your opponent may drop 3 stones instead of 2 on
his next turn (and only on his next turn).
5. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest
group wins. If the playersâ€™ largest groups are the same size, compare
their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which
aren't the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.

Late in the game, the largest group will be extended nearly every
turn, and these new rules will yield a game similar to that of the
rules I posted at the top of the thread. But earlier in the game,
with these new rules, taking the lead no longer means allowing your
opponent to get a whole string of turns with extra stones, but instead
gives him just one. This means there's incentive to extend the
largest group earlier to try to secure a positional advantage. Also,
these rules are even shorter and more understandable. I just tested
it against myself twice, and it seems preferable. The feel is very
much the same, but the midgame starts earlier. Yip. If after more
testing the opinion persists, there may be a Ketchup 4.0. This is
getting ridiculous, but there you have it.
