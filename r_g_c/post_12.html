In a previous thread, I wrote (as an afterthought):-
_______

Another option is to make the board topologically different,
then have a different (but very similar) game, say, "Circular Y".

   a a a
 a . . . c     Winner's group touches a, b and c, as before.
a . . . . c
. . . . . c
b . . . . c
 b . . . c
   b b b
_______

In fact, I think I wrote about these in my earlier article on HEX-Y
to r.g.a. of many years ago, (when that was still a viable option).

As the game is completely impartial, (especially with PIE),
it doesn't really matter WHAT physical shape the board is,
so long as it is combinatorially the same, i.e. marked into
three regions along the sides, and trivalent internally.

So we could have, "SQUARE Y"...

   a a a a a a a a
b . . . . . . . . . c
 b . . . . . . . . c
b . . . . . . . . . c    Winner is a connected group
 b . . . . . . . . c     touching all three letters.
b . . . . . . . . . c
 b . . . . . . . . c
b . . . . . . . . . c
 b . . . . . . . . c     [Assuaging the bookcase storing problem!]
b . . . . . . . . . c
   b b b b c c c c

...or various length-ratios of RECTANGULAR Y.

Note that the a, b, c regions need not be symmetric or even have
the same length of cells. Here is PENTANGULAR Y:-

     b . a
    b . . a
   b . . . a
  b . . . . a
 b . . . . . a
b . . . . . . a
 . . . . . . .
c . . . . . . c
 c . . . . . c
  c . . . . c
     c c c

And so on. Mix and match, garnish and season to taste!

Be Y's and play many Y's, people... ;-)
