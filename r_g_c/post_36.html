Hi !
I tried your Verto applet. The game seems interesting and i like it because there are some new concepts.
The AI didn't seem very strong, i don't know if i was playing at a particularly low level. I reached a situation when it is my turn, there are only to possible squares where i can play (those with the tiny pale red dot) and in both places I would convert more than one Blu pieces. Therefore these moves are forbidden. I can't manage to play in other squares and i can't find a "pass" button. What am i doing wrong ?

thankx !
bye !

It seems the AI plays not very strong in a browser context with
reduced heap space. The Java application available at

http://spielstein.com/games/verto/verto.jar
java -jar verto.jar <STRENGTH>
w/ <STRENGTH> = 1..n

plays much stronger (depending on the power of the computer you're
using).

The rules say you *may* play there. You only have to decide which
stone to capture in a second step.

If you really must pass, just click a space.

Hi,
there's a new and bugfixed Happy-New-Year-version of the Verto Applet
available at

http://spielstein.com/games/verto/play

It's not so easy to beat the computer player now.
