Implo is an original territory game for two players: Black and White.
It is played on the intersections of a square board, which is
initially empty. The suggested size is 19x19, as in Go, but any others
are also possible. There are two kinds of stones of each color: pawns
and kings. Draws and cycles are not possible in this game.

For a comfortable play on a physical board, you can use stones with
one white and one black side. Half the stones show some symbol on the
black side, and half the stones show it on the white side. These
represent black and white kings, respectively.

DEFINITIONS

In this rules, "adjacent" always means "orthogonally adjacent". A
group is a set of like-colored, adjacent stones. A group can contain
pawns, kings or both. A pawn is dead when it belongs to a group with
no empty intersections adjacent to it. A dead group is a group with
one or more dead pawns. Alpha is the color of the last played stone,
which need not be the player's color. Beta is the color which is not
alpha.

PLAY

Starting with Black, players take turns placing one stone of ANY color
on an empty intersection. After a placement, if there are no dead
pawns, the turn ends. If there are any dead pawns:

a) All the beta dead pawns become alpha kings. This is called
"flipping".

b) All the alpha pawns in the groups adjacent to the beta dead groups
are removed from the board.

c) If there are any alpha dead groups at this moment, a) and b) are
repeated with colors inverted, i.e., all the pawns in the alpha dead
groups become beta kings, and all the beta pawns in the groups
adjacent to the alpha dead groups are removed.

A player can pass his turn at any moment. When both players pass in
succession, the game ends.

OBJECTIVE

At the end of the game, the player with the most stones (pawns and
kings) of his color on the board wins. In case of a tie, the player
who passed first during the game wins.

SAMPLE POSITIONS

x -> black stone
# -> black king
o -> white stone
@ -> white king

- Position #1:

o x . . x
o . x . .
x . . x .
x x . x .
. . . . .

Black places a black pawn on b4, flipping the two white pawns (which
become black kings) and removing five black pawns plus the played
pawn:

# . . . x
# . . . .
. . . x .
. . . x .
. . . . .

- Position #2:

. . # # .
x # o x x
. x @ . .
. . x . .
x # x o x

White places a black pawn on d3, flipping the white pawn (which
becomes a black king) and removing seven black pawns plus the played
pawn:

. . # # .
. # # . .
. . @ . .
. . . . .
. # . o x

Please note that the black pawns on a1 and a4 are also removed. Pawns
and kings of the same color, if adjacent, are all part of the same
group. The black pawn on e1 is not removed because it does not belong
to any group adjacent to the flipped pawn's group.

- Position #3:

. . o o .
o @ # # o
. . # # #
. o o o #
. . . . o

White places a white pawn on b3. None of the black stones are flipped,
because they are all kings. Thus, as there are no dead black groups,
the pawns in the surrounding white groups are not removed:

. . o o .
o @ # # o
. o # # #
. o o o #
. . . . o

COMMENTS

Implo is a game similar to Go in that players try to surround enemy
groups in order to score points. In Implo, however, the groups which
succeed in the battle get corrupted by vanity and die, whereas the
defeated (surrounded) enemy groups are not only kept alive by their
captors, but converted into invincible soldiers to their service.
Also, as players can use stones of both colors, they can take
advantage of their own losses by joining the opponent's attacking
groups into one. This way, they are forced to finish their charge
together and die en masse.

Some people seems to find it a bit difficult to understand the rules
of Implo as they are worded now. They are very simple, though, so I
must be blamed for not having been able to explain them properly. To
make them clearer, it may be useful to summarize the three basic
concepts used in this game:

a) Captures proceed as in Go, except that surrounded groups are not
removed, but flipped to show the opposing color. (Also, still as in
Go, dead stones of the opposite color to the played stone are flipped
first. Then, if any stones of the played color remain dead, they are
flipped the same way.)

b) When such flippings are made, all the groups surrounding the
flipped group(s) are removed.

c) To prevent cycles, any stone on the board can only be flipped once.
Once it is flipped, it can't be removed from the board, too. Flipped
stones are called kings.

I've added the above text to the rules file. The game rules are still
exactly the same, so I hope this doesn't break the contest rules.

In another thread, Tristan complained that an Implo game, even on a
9x9 board, takes too long. He's absolutely right. In the rules, I
suggested a 19x19 board, which is monstruous. I would like to change
it to, say, 7x7 or 8x8, but I'm not sure if it's allowed at this stage
of the contest. In my particular game, board size is not a rule but
just a suggestion, so maybe it's all right...

What do you think, Nick?
