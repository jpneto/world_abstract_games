Many people have wondered about a form of "Y" to be played on a Hexhex board.

One possibility is OC merely to mark off three regions of the
boundary, and play ordinary Y on that.

|    b b b
|   b . . . c    The boundary is surrounded by a multicolored ring
|  b . . . . c   in three colours - Amber, Blue & Crimson. :)
|   . . . . . c
|  a . . . . c   The winner is whoever makes a group touching all
|   a . . . c    3 colours - a , b , c .
|    a a a

That is fine, but is probably too close to ordinary Y to be interesting,
and in any event doesn't really make use of the (global) hexagonal
nature of the board.

People want a Y-like game where the winning condition is to connect
any 3 sides which are mutually non-adjacent (possibly including
extra sides as well). This still has the no-double-win (non-racing)
property, but doesn't have the no-ties property, alas. Various
proposals have been made to account for this, mostly consisting of
banning the possibility of making a "cross", a group crossing from any
side to the directly opposite side, (which is the chief way of tieing
the simpler version), unless in so doing one achieves an immediate Y.
Cameron Bwrowne's "Cross" is a game of this type.

Unfortunately, this is not a satisfactory solution to the problem,
as Joao and I have found in a series of games. There is too much
emphasis on "negative" or "cold" moves, as an emergent phenomenon.
OC some people will like the appearance of this effect, as one can make
tricky moves that play off on the opponent's inability to make some blocks
which would involve making a direct cross. Also there is this horror...

|     . . . .
|    . . o . x      Here is an even worse situation.
|   . o o . x .     o is clearly dominating the whole game,
|  . . . o . x .    and only needs to touch on the north and
|   x x . o . x     northwest edges to win, and x cannot stop either.
|    . x . o o
|     . x o .       BUT with crosses forbidden, o can never do either!
|                   So, x will gradually fill in the boundary, and"win".

We have considered various alternatives, such as allowing crosses
but making it incumbent on the (first) crossing-maker to subsequently
make a Y, or else his opponent wins (i.e. wins the eventual on-board
tie).

But though this avoids the "cold move" aspect of things, to some
extent, it means the rules need cumbersome wording.

Or so we thought, until it struck us that it can all be accomplished
by the simple wording...

(1) The WINNER is whoever makes a group connecting 3 non-adjacent
sides, OR
(2) otherwise whoever made the first opposite-sided touching group
LOSES.

This seems a very brief and natural way of stating a game-win
criterion.
It provides a discouragement to making a "cross", without forbidding
it
entirely (thus opening the door for cold-move play).

What do people think?

Note: it is still remotely possible to achieve an actual tie,
with 4 parallel groups, such as...

|   o o o
|  x x x x (both now pass, passing is allowed any time - no cold moves!)
| . . . . .
|  o o o o
|   x x x

... but my feeling is that this is so incredibly unlikely that,
if it did happen, the players both deserve one!

You're just saying that because I beat you :)

I considered this variant during the development of Cross but it
seemed less interesting, being just another "positive connection" or
connection race game with an added rule to decide deadlocks. The Cross
rule of "win with a 3-connection but lose with a 2-connection" adds
another element as there are competing aspects of positive and
negative connection, i.e. a move that strengthens a 3-connection might
also strengthen a 2-connection so there are careful decisions to be
made with most moves.

Another thing is that the Cross rule set (positive and negative
connections) will make games longer and more involved than the rule
set you suggest with strictly positive connections. With your rules,
players will form a virtual connection and the game will end, whereas
with Cross players can intrude into opponent's virtual connections and
possibly break through them due to the threat of 2-connection, which
can't be done in other connection games. The end result is that a
greater percentage of the board will be used in the average game
between experienced players than for most other connection games,
which is a quality that I admire in Conhex, and deeper games can be
played on smaller boards.

You describe these virtual connection intrusions as "cold moves" but I
see them as something much more interesting, they subvert the usual
positive connection mechanism that I've seen in many, many games and
make virtual connections assailable. This often throws up interesting
surprises. Cross can get quite mind-bending even on smaller boards,
which I believe constitutes a good return on depth versus rule
simplicity.

Did you do test games, in fact?
Or play against yourself a bit?

My little tests suggest there is still a cold-move element,
but a mild amount, not the thoroughly confusing feature
involved in full cross-prohibition.

Far too many, in Joao's and my experience.
And total lack of clarity. No move seems to be
determinable as "good" or "bad". Now a bit of
such a feature can be a good thing in a game,
but Cross seems to have a vast amount of it.

Ultimately it is OC merely a matter of taste, but we prefer
a fair bit of clarity as opposed to random confusion,
(which is why I don't much care for Reversi, either.)

If you play a bit more you might work out what's going on and pick up
some of the strategy.
