Hi All,

I'll post an official games list with links and instructions later,
after the day is out, but I just want to mention the ones I've got so
far to make sure I'm not missing any. Here are the games I know of:

Abeo
Arrello
Devil's Advocate
Implo
Kitaran
Mortars
Pilf
Travicus
Verto

Please point me to contest games I haven't listed here.

Best,
Nick

You're missing mine, Deadcell, but that's because I just posted it.

Can we sign up to be a voter or is it only for people who have entered

As long as you're a member of this forum, and you play each contest
entry at least once, you can vote. I'm about to post the game links
plus instructions, in a about 20 minutes, so stay tuned.

Hi
I tryed to enter the group to submit a game of mine but i received the mail that confirms that my subscription to the group has been accepted only today. Am I on time to submit my game ?
It is called Isaac and you can find it here: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/88113/isaac.
If I am still on time, please send me the address where i can formally add the game to the contest.
thank you very much

oh ops, i am sorry, i just noticed my game isn't eligible for submission because it doesn't conform to the rules. sorry to have bothered you all but I just saw there was a game design contest and i though it was constraint-free :)

well, good luck to the partecipants and i hope there will be more contests !
bye !
