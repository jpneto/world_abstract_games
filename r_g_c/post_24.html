As an abstract games fan, I'm really curious to know the rules of
Corey Clark's Radiolarians, a game he has mentioned sometimes as being
already "finished".

Clark, why don't you share it with us? Even if it is not as good as
the elegant Particle Bond, it's always nice to read about your new
designs...

I've seen it played and it looks pretty interesting.
