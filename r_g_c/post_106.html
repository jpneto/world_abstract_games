Hi Everyone,

It's recently come to my attention that ko does not apply to Go played on a hexagonal grid. 

Can anyone point me to any reference that cites this fact (book, article, newsgroup post, etc)?

Regards,

I've noticed that, too, and I think longer cycles can never occur with sensible play, either, but I can't prove it.

The same applies to Slither Go.

That's a very dangerous comment! "Sensible play" is very hard
to define, even though we all think "we know it when we see it",
like the US supreme court used to do with pornography.

Certainly it's possible to conjure up repeated situations,
by the brutal method of having someone fill up the board
except for one space, have the other take them all,
then repeat (with a few passes when necessary).

But that's obviously not what Cam was meaning.

Perhaps his definition could be, "a subset of the board,
that contains a repeating situation, that remains so
even when that subset is embedded into an infinite board
with all other cells empty".

But even that could possibly be worked around!

Just another cute little matter related to this.

There are three types of regular board grids
that go-like games could be played on,

a: hexagonal;
b: quadrilateral, (the standard type);
c: triangular.

c is little known, even among abstract gamers.
It is easiest modelled by playing on the *intersections*
of a hexagonal board, rather than in the (hexagonal) cells.

In a great many ways, mathematically, case b is "halfway"
between case a and case c.

Concerning the matter of kos, this is also the case!

In case a, kos cannot exist at all, as we are discussing.

In case b, they crop up quite often, and can form
a vital and interesting part of the game.

In case c, they occur all over the place, at the drop of a hat,
and make the game almost unplayable in its complexity.
(Trust me on this, I've tried to play it!)

So again, case b is midwway between the other two.

That's very cute IMHO.

It's interesting to note that most conceivable Go variants without crosscuts are soft-finite (finite with any remotely sensible play) as well:

- Orcoon Go (hypothetical Go variant in which all the patterns mentioned throughout the Orcoon thread on r.g.a., including diagonal placements, are banned),
- Konobi Go (Go with Konobi connectivity and placement restrictions),
- Crossway Go (exactly what you're thinking)
- and possibly Slither Go, too, as I said, even though the movement of pieces would complicate any proof.

I find it rather amazing how the crosscuts inherent in non-trivalent grids are a problem both in Go variants (causing cycles) and connection games (causing deadlocks).

Good point! I presume hard finite means there is an upper bound
beyond
which it is impossible to play longer than? Do you have a reference
for these terms?

It never occurred to me that all the non-Go games you mentioned
can also be turned into Go variants - very cool observation!

Actually, I think maybe not all that amount.

Excellent point, again.

And in fact, that's the *real* issue involved here. So, getting
back to the original thread, it would be far more useful to prove
that a game was ko-free IF AND ONLY IF it couldn't allow cross-cuts.

The other is then a simple corollary, based on the trivial
observation that cross-cuts can only occur (absent other rules)
on boards with all-triangular regions. (Considering a region to be
2-dimensional, bounded by the liberty-lines for the game
in question; with plays occurring on the vertices.)

And in fact there is ONLY ONE such board, locally speaking,
which is the triangular board thus...

    _\/__\/__\/__\/__\/_
     /\  /\  /\  /\  /\
    /__\/__\/__\/__\/__\ 
    \  /\  /\  /\  /\  /
    _\/__\/__\/__\/__\/_
     /\  /\  /\  /\  /\

As in ordinary Go, plays are on vertices.
(In practice it tends to be played on hex boards
with plays in the cells. The vertex-play system is
more mathematically natural, though fully equivalent.)

Yes, it's a synonym of "theoretically finite". I also like to use the term "naturally finite" for those games which are hard-finite without the superko rule, like Hex. "Soft finite" is harder to conceptualize and there may be a subjective note to it, but refers to those games where any potentially cyclic move can be trivially proven to be a bad move. For example, a game on a chess board, with a white king on e1 and a black king on e8, without captures and with the goal of taking your king to the opponent's first row. On such a game, sideways and backward moves are trivially bad moves. But, of course, for many games, defining "trivial" is far from trivial...

    Do you have a reference
    for these terms?

I don't, but I've come across them quite often in abstract games discussions.
 

    the trivial observation that cross-cuts can only occur (absent other rules)
    on boards with all-triangular regions, [with play] on vertices.

It's actually the opposite: crosscuts are only impossible on boards with all-triangular regions.

Actually, this is not exactly correct. I'm no authority on the matter, but the proper definition, as far as I'm concerned, would be as follows:

A game is soft finite if no position can be constructed where optimal play leads to a cycle.

Of course, determining that a soft finite game is soft finite is usually much harder than determining that a hard finite game is hard finite, but that doesn't mean there's anything subjective to it.
