Still going from the possibility that a contest is organized, and the
above theme is included, and my little brainwave complies with it,
I'd like to notify those who care that I've changed the name from Whingi
to "Lhexus": http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/lhexus-560

Indeed the contest thread is moving here. I think we were still
organizing the contest though. Nick was just sharing some potential
themes for the contest but we hadn't really settled on anything.
Lhexus takes the Symple theme in an interesting direction. I'm not
sure how it accomplishes the design goal though. I believe that the
creation of a single pattern is supposed to preclude the creation of a
duplicate pattern. In Lhexus you try to create more of the patterns
than your opponent. Maybe I don't understand the challenge properly
though. As I mentioned this particular challenge is difficult to
accomplish, let alone do well, so the number of entries would be
pretty small I imagine. I'm leaning towards the stone recycling idea
myself, however I worry that this would be unfair since it's been my
pet project for 2 months now. I'm thinking maybe we should draw
something completely out of left field to put everyone on an even
playing field. Perhaps something odd like 'adapt a story into an
abstract game'. This is something I'd never even consider since my
approach to abstract design is very scientific.

I'm not sure I understand your last sentece here. Bill mentions a
'local' pattern, and the line, hex and triangle are local patterns. On
the other hand, Bill mentions a full board at the end, and Lhexus
definitely won't have that.

Let's await further input. About the level playing field, that should
be obvious. However, if the theme is chosen and Lhexus does meet its
criteria, I'd like the jury to keep in mind that I made the game in an
hour or so, _after_ reading the challenge.

It's not that I had something on the shelf - the field was empty and
quite level.

I'm glad he started it regardless of the outcome because for me the
outcome happened to be Lhexus, and I find that rewarding enough in
itself, even if I possibly misunderstood the theme Bill suggested.

And it appears to have turned out nicely too :)
Rules: http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/lhexus-560
First game: http://mindsports.nl/cgi-bin/Arena/Serve.cgi?file=Lhexus1289152326.html

Remember, valid configurations may not overlap: any stone may only be
counted in ONE configuration.
The counter just counts stones on the board because in case of a tie
in the number of valid configurations, the player with the lesser
number wins.

P.S. I can't seem to upload a pict in my profile. I have a correct
sized jpeg (RGB) 50x50, and the pop up box let's me select it but
after 'upload' it gives a cancel/crop choice and displays an 'image
question mark' saying presumably something like "hey I can't find
that image I just had you select". Clicking 'crop picture' brings me
back to where I started. Can anyone help?

OK, I seem to have lost the "Contest" concept during the changeover.

1. Is the Contest thingy formalized yet?
2. What are its parameters, or are we still discussing that?

No, yes, hopefully and I don't know.

Anyway, Lhexus is a bit beyond entering, because we would have to
consider it before a theme is established. So I'm happily withdrawing
it, pleased as I am with te plain fact of finding it in the first
place. I'll wait to see what comes out, and enter if the theme
'strikes a chord' - maybe another game will be so kind as to drop
by :) .

P.S. Still no clue how to upload the profile pict.

Hi All,

Apologies for being so slow to post. I was away from the interwebs
over the weekend. Yes, we don't have a theme for the contest yet,
although perhaps we could designate the theme so that Christian's game
could qualify. I don't want to be the one who picks the theme all by
myself however, because it should be something we're all interested
in. It sounds like there's considerable interest in Bill's "local
pattern" challenge, although in that case I don't think Christian's
game would qualify, at least according to my understanding.

The local-pattern challenge might not be suitable for another reason:
it's difficult and there's a good chance that nobody will be able to
design a game that satisfies it. I know I've dwelt fruitlessly on the
problem for a while. So, it may be better to choose a constraint
which is not so tough. All of the ideas that I initially proposed are
pretty difficult, so here's another one.

How about the following, which I shall call Design-a-Game-Less-Crappy-
than-Othello-Using-Similar-Mechanisms?

A game which satisfies the following constraints.

2 players place must take turns placing differently colored stones on a board
the stones are two-sided, and some in-game event(s) cause stones to flip 
(win condition needn't be Othello win condition)

This is nice and easy, and no doubt there's plenty of potential to
design something preferable to Othello.

Another challenge, and one for which Christian's game would qualify,
would be a pattern-building game where there are multiple local-
pattern win conditions.

If you guys are agreeable to one of these, let me know. I'll choose
the one that gets more interest in this thread and then I'll announce
a deadline, say 3 weeks or a month later, anybody who wants can post
an entry here in our new little forum, and then we'll use (condorcet?)
voting to determine the winner.

Best,
Nick

That challenge was:
"a pattern-completion game with the Hex-like properties of one unique
winner when the board is full, but where the pattern is LOCAL instead
of GLOBAL, as in Hex. By local I mean the pattern is not defined by
anything other than the relative arrangement of stones in the
pattern. 4-in-a-row is an example of a local pattern. The Hex
pattern, on the other hand, is global because it's definition makes
reference to the edges of the board."

I understand that Lhexus doesn't qualify because of the multiple local
patterns, so I assume it must be the completion of one? But what about
the board being 'full'. Must such a game necessarily end with a full
board. And if not, why doesn't 4-in-a-row qualify? (just as an
example). I'm just trying to get the challenge straight.

"It's difficult" ... but isn't a challenge supposed to be, to qualify
as 'challenge'?

No doubt :), but it triggers another general question: do existing
games qualify?
Of course MacBeth is just as crappy as Othello, but Lotus would do
nicely, not to mention Medusa.

Tayloring the challenge to fit the game would make the challenge
appear unfair.

I may have made a mistake assuming Combinatorial was synonymous with

Can you formalize this objective?

Anyway, some thoughts the contest:

1. I would prefer to build the contest around a strategical objective
(like territory).

2. I think the minimum deadline should be 6 weeks.

3. Do we vote the games just from an a priori point of view? Maybe we
should judge the emergent gameplay too...

Obviously the entries should be playtested, but how indeed? We can't
very well wait to see if a game proves itself over the decades. So
what will be the procedure and who will be in the jury?

Group members could offer themselves to playtest and grade
a small set of game entries (excluding their own submissions).

Each game should have at least 3 or 4 players playtesting it.

Grades should be simple, say, 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent)

Personally I think both a territory objective (having more stones on
the board at the end of the game) and the conversion capture method
are reasonable requirements. The designs need to be in some decent
range of each other for voters to be able to judge them with some
objectivity. Let me put it this way, imagine judging a design contest
in which Hex, Othello and Go were entries. I might even go so far as
to opt to standardize the board options. I think the design
requirements should pose a bit of a challenge on their own as well. If
we didn't keep the conversion capture method, I would push for
theoretical finiteness and no draws to be requirements in tandem with
the territory objective. All this is just in the interest of making
judging the contest as objective as possible. It doesn't have to be a
complete popularity contest. :D

I think that the best option is we limit the board options to hex and
square topologies and playtest each game in the sandbox at iggc.
Alternatively we could use Google Docs giving us more freedom in terms
of board topologies, but the downside is Google Docs is highly
impractical compared to iggc's sandbox. I think the contestants should
each have a vote with the proviso that they are not allowed to vote
for their own game. Of course this could lead to vote 4 vote
situations but I think we can all be held to the honor system. ;)
Besides, I think the designers themselves will probably have some
clear principals that they will judge the other games by, after 6
weeks of slaving over a hot Go-Ban. :D

btw Nick, besides bragging rights have you managed to set up anything
promising in the way of prizes?

Yes, Benedikt also saw immediately that it is a meta mechanism,
applicable in 'territorial' themes, loosely defined.

In Symple and Charyb it's either/or, which brings the element of
timing into the equation. In Symple it results in a 'placement stage'
and a 'growing stage' with an opaque tipping point area in between.
In Charyb this division will likely emerge likewise. Symple's rules
concerning connecting groups are somewhat more strict. Charyb doesn't
need that because its changes are far more dramatic, outweighing such
refinements (and a swap for that matter).
Lhexus is different in that it employs both options in the same turn,
and thus lacks the timing element of the other two.

Although ... not quite. The negative feedback of capture may result in
so few groups (big as they may be) that placement is preferable, so a
division between stages may be less emphatic.

Ok, thanks for the feedback so far. It seems to me like the group's
preferences regarding the contest constraints are:

1. 2 players
2. the game must include some flipping method.
3. win condition is: most stones on the board when board is full wins

And the other conditions:

1. 6 weeks to deadline
2. Evaluation period: why don't we say two weeks following submission
deadline?
3. Evaluation method. How about: Condorcet voting, you can't vote
for your own game, and only people who have demonstrably played each
of the submitted games on iggc sandbox during the evalution period may
vote (I include this game designers get frustrated when people judge
our games without actually playing them).
4. Prize: maybe we write a collective review of the game on BGG? I
suggest this because games that get reviews on BGG generally get a
boost in visibility.
5. One entry per person. I suggest this because the more games there
are to evaluate, the more cumbersome this whole thing becomes. But
let's say that you can revise your entry up to the deadline as much as
you want, so that, for example, Christian can change his submission if
he wants.

Speaking of which: Christian, you are unusually productive for a
"retired" designer. You threaten to become the Brett Favre of our
little world (American sports reference, which you probably don't get
because your both Dutch and probably not a big American Football fan.)

LAAAAaaaaame! I'm sure we can get Arty Sandler and Aaron Dalton
interested in programming the winning entry on their respective sites.
What ever happened to thinking big? You were talking about Nestor
publishing the winning entry before! I liked that Nick Bentley more
than this new one :D. Did you contact him and he said he wouldn't?
Maybe we should try to make a bigger deal about this contest...

Wikied him :)
And yes, it occured to me that I have too many 'final whispers' than
credibility concerning retirement would support, so I adapted and
rearranged part of my essay. In the epilogue I've dedicated a
paragraph to the problem:

"Come November 2010 there was no denying: I may be able, someway
sometime, to stop inventing games, but intentions and expectations to
that effect don't seem to work very well. I don't hunt for games, but
occasionally one gets too close, and when I smell prey I can't resist.
There's no effort involved, no fumbling with pieces and boards, and no
interference in my much appreciated daily routine, so who am I to
intend, expect or complain?
I'm a game whisperer, nolens volens."

To be fair: I hunted this one :)

And 'this one' has been renamed "Charybdis" after the mythological
monster that used to pester Odysseus during his Odyssey by creating
annoying maelstroms.

As a matter of routine, the game has been translated to the square
plane, likewise restricting capture to the main directions, lest the
maelstrom should engulf both players ;-) :

Heh. Ok I've contacted Arty to see if he's interested. I'll write a
review of the winner on BGG in any case, just because it sounds fun to
me. I don't know Nestor. Can someone who knows Nestor contact him
about this? (I don't know him)

I contacted him in January via <submi...@nestorgames.com> to see if
he might be interested in a havannah/hexade combination. The reply was
somewhat disappointing:

"Hi, Christian.

I'm adding you to my friends page ;)
I'm looking for games that cannot be played with the games I've
already published. Do you have any?"

I didn't quite get the wink and the "do you have any" , considering I
had included a link to mindsports.nl ;)

Ok, Arty's agreed to implement the winner on iggc. I think this is
enough to get us started. If we get Nestor's agreement, that will be
icing on the cake.

In an earlier post I suggested that only the votes of people who
demonstrably playtest all the games in the iggc sandbox will count.
It occurs to me that this might not work if someone submits a game
that can't be played in the sandbox, due to unusual topology or what
have you.

The simplest alternative is to let any member of this forum vote, and
not worrying about verifying that folks have actually played the games
they're rating. Plus, then the losers can console themselves by
telling themselves that the voters neglected to actually play their
games.

Other suggestions?

I'd much prefer a 'sandbox solution', though I too don't see how the
'not playable in the sandbox' issue can be resolved.
But a voter just playing with his kids or with a neighbor, might
easily miss aspects of a game that would reveal themselves under the
scrutiny of a bunch of onlookers at iGGC, be it bugs or beauty.

Joao, hex and square topologies are the most common ones anyway. I
think the practicality of playtesting the games in the sandbox for the
evaluation process far outweighs the limitation on the designers. I'm
all for the games being compatible with the iggc sandbox because it
will allow us to playtest the games in an organized and structured
way.

We only have three constraints, territory objective, capture by

Ok, I have changed my mind. I agree with you now.

Can you formalize "territory objective" and "capture by conversion"?

If we do allow games that are not practical to play in the iggc
sandbox the play-testing process should be carried out in google docs
for each game, even those that are practical to play in the sandbox.
Otherwise people might be biased against the games that couldn't be

Matt has asked me to formalize the design constraints for this contest
so I am going to do so now.

Territory Objective: Very simple, the objective is to have more stones
on the board at the end of the game.
Capture by Conversion: stones convert to the opposite color during the
gameplay by some mechanism
Playable in the iggc sandbox: this means the board for your game must
use a square or hexagonal tiling.

of course all of this can be negotiated still. Let's just hope nobody
is in the negotiating mood *pulls out crowbar* ;)

The reason for this is not be so lucky - Nestor uses a standard laser

pieces (yet).
