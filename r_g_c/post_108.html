 There have been many attempts to find a nice version of Hex/Y
to play on a hex-hex board, where the winning criterion is to make
a group connecting three sides that are all mutually adjacent.
(It doesn't matter if the group joins 4, 5 or 6 sides, as long
as three of them are mutually non-adjacent.) This is a nice
criterion as regards the "no pure racing" goal, in that both
players cannot be simultaneously in a winning position.

It is not so good regarding non-drawing, however, as it is
easy and common for both sides to make a group connecting
two opposite sides, which ensures a tie.

Most of the differences between the variants revolve around dealing
with this phenomenon. And most, even all, of them, while often
very playable, do not result in a game that is very close to
the basic Hex or Y games. Often they have extra features that
are fascinating in themselves, and make good games, but just
not close to the originals. This is an ongoing problem!

Here is another attempt at the matter, which has resulted in yet
another game which is (I hope) good in itself, but not very close
to the originals. It is quite simple, and introduces the "chicken"
element seen in Unlur and similar games.

It is very simple.

---
CHICKEN Y: Played on a completely regular hex-hex board.

Players alternately place 1, 2 or 3 black stones anywhere on
the board. At any time, rather than place any stones, a player
may announce "I take black", play no stone of either colour,
and then the game continues with his opponent playing the first
white stone, from which they play black and white alternately.

If the taker makes a black group touching three non-adjacent
sides, he wins. If this not has happened before the game ends,
the non-taker, white, wins. The game ends when the board is full,
or when black has made a winning group.
---

So only one player is charged with making a winning group,
the other merely has to prevent him. These asymetric games
are often fun. The Y-maker is determined by the chicken method
of making it more and more likely that black will win.

The 1- , 2- or 3-optional element of placement is

(1) to speed up the start a little, and
(2) to prevent any "opposition" effects appearing in the opening.

Happy gaming!

Hah. This is one of those why-didn't-I-think-of-it games. I suggest that it may solve another problem as well: the problem of center dominance, which is my biggest complaint about all Y games. The chicken mechanism will force players to drop the stones during the bid away from the center of the board, which should make the center weaker and other areas stronger. If so, this could be a *very* good game indeed.

That is a very good point, which hadn't occurred to me. Nice.

I hope so.

So, anyone for an email game?

Also, isn't Cameron Browne's Cross better than that anyway? They're both similar to Unlur, but Cross gets rid of the chicken element, so it's closer to Hex and Y.

With due respect to Cameron, Unlur is clearly the better game.

Cross suffers from the same weakness every other game with a one move
swap and too many symmetries does, namely limited openings. Compare
this to Unlur, with its many options and strategies in the Chicken
phase. Note that a many move swap protocol could not achieve this.
And there is a unforeseeable twist in the
openings coming directly from the draw preventing rule that
fulfilling the opponent's winning condition without fulfilling your
own loses the game: check the V opening.

Hi,

Ummm... that covers a lot of games :)  I don't think this is really an issue.

However, there is a problem with Cross which Bill and Joao pointed out in this newsgroup a while ago. Unfortunately it's possible to achieve positions in which a critical cell can develop that constitutes a losing move for both players, so the game goes cold as players fill the rest of the board until forced to make the fatal move. Shame :(

Yes, although I would not call them games, but rulesets.

Everybody and his dog jumped by the no draws, please, and if it
needs balance, I'll have the pie rule, thank you, bandwagon. And
hexhex boards look so cool!

That gave us many rulesets, but it is not game design.

Are those positions (cold wars, as you call them) possible in Unlur as well? If so, could you show an example?

I wondered about that myself. But the two games are subtly different:

Unlur:
White Y = win for Black
White L = win for White
Black Y = win for Black
Black L = win for White

Cross:
White Y = win for White
White L = win for Black
Black Y = win for Black
Black L = win for White

i.e. in Unlur the players have different goals (relative to absolute colour), whereas in Cross both players have identical goals (relative to their own colour).

So I don't think that the exact cases that will be a problem in Cross will also be problems in Unlur.

    Cross suffers  from the same weakness every other game with a one move

I didn't mean that Cross was better than Unlur, but that Cross was possibly better than the suggestion of Bill and mine. As far as I'm concerned, whether it is or not depends on how often cold wars arise, but, then again, the very fact that they're possible is a conceptual problem in itself.

As for limited openings, I don't think they're a problem at all, since the branching factor is broadened as soon as the symmetry is broken.

Perhaps it's time to mention that Joao and I have been playing *yet another* variant of
hexhex Y, in fact a variant of Cross. It was invented to try to sort out the cold war
aspect of Cross, which it has done, but only at the cost of introducing an element that is
even further away from the basic hex-connection game such as Hex or Y.

The new idea is that a player MAY make a cross, (i.e. between two opposite parallel sides),
without making a Y also, PROVIDED that when he does, he immediately removes some other stone of
his colour that destroys the cross. So "death cells" which are the bane of standard Cross, can be played in without immediate loss. The removal is part of the same turn, and can only be done for the purpose
of releasing a cross.

It is conceivable that a game may never end, due to no further solo stones being added as both add-&-subtract stones endlessly, but so far we have never seen this happen.

And though it is no longer a simple connection game in the style of Hex and Y and Atoll, it has fascinating wrinkles of its own that make it a very worthwhile game.
In particular the corner cells become very much more significant, even though they have no special
features by the rules, other than their usual property of belonging to two adjacent sides.
So far we have been playing on very small boards, but it is already very difficult to
analyse in any depth.

We recommend it.

Limited openings are a problem. Imagine for instance - to
overstate the point, but just by a little - that Chess were
balanced by giving White b4 as the first move. It does not
help that Chess branches after that. A lot or even most of
Chess would be lost.

On a strongly symmetric board, there are few distinct first
moves, and there are even less when you consider the pie
rule. Then, in many games, there are few good answers left
to these few first moves - usually there are obvious strong
moves. It gets worse when the first player has not so many
options as his answer in turn. Many of these games have the
first two or three moves staged. And the worst thing is that
the staged succession of moves may leave little variety in
strategic ideas.


As for Unlur having a cold aspect, that is why you may not
play the edge during the bidding stage. I am still impressed
by how quickly Jorge looked through that.
