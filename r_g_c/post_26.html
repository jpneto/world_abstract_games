Game Design Constraints:
1. Win Condition: winner is player with majority stones on board when
board is full.
2. Capture by Conversion: stones convert to the opposite color during
the gameplay by some mechanism.
3. Playable in the iggc sandbox: this means the board for your game
must use a square or hexagonal tiling.
4. Game should be for 2 players only.

Contest Rules
1. Each entrant may submit no more 1 game to the contest.
2. Final entries are due on or before Dec 23rd
3. If you submit your entry before then, you may modify it up until
the due date.
4. Any member of this forum may enter a design.
5. Entrants: submit your game by sending a link to the final rules to
nickobento [at] gmail.com. Do so even if you've posted the rules on
this forum. I'll publish a list of links on this forum the day after
the entries are due.
6. Following the deadline, there will be a two-week evaluation period
(Dec 23 to Jan 6), during which voters will have a chance to playtest
the submitted games.
7. To be an eligible voter, you must a) be a member of this forum;
and b) play each of the contest entries in the iggc sandbox during the
evaluation period at least once.
8. Votes are due on or before Jan 6, 2011
9. To vote, each voter will provide a list of the games ordered by
preference, from most preferred to least preferred. The winner will
be determined by an instant runoff (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)
10. To voters: please send your votes to nickobento [at] gmail.com
11. I'll announce the winner on January 7, 2011

One question: would anybody mind if I entered this contest, despite
the fact that I'm running it? I've got several concepts rattling
around in my head. If anyone is uncomfortable with it, speak up.

I would prefer designers cannot vote for their own games. There is no
point to do that, and the objectivity is difficult.

The election method I'm using makes this not such a big deal. I
encourage entrants to give their highest votes to their own games. If
all entrants do so, then there won't be any effect at all.

In the unlikely event that it causes some kind of problem, we'll just
run the next contest differently. At the end of this contest, I'll
review the vote distribution and solicit feedback from everyone, so
that the second contest is more free of whatever difficulties arise in
this one. Your patience is requested.

Here is my entry:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1srFSg9giobPqJ1iyNAjjaf-i4N6OX-xDCHcTM2EDmcU/edit?hl=en&authkey=COLfw4UE#

It's the first time I've tried this sort of thing. I hope someone has
fun with it. the game will take only 30 turns for each player. Draws
are not possible.

Here's the text only version:

Travicus
tra â€“ pull
vicus â€“ change

Board and Pieces
Travicus is played on an 8x8 board with white and black stones. The
stones are placed on the board cells as in checkers or chess, and not
on the intersections as in Go.

The initial position has alternating colored stones in each of the 4
corners. White stones at a1 and h8, black stones at a8 and h1.

Objective
The goal is to have more stones of your color on the board than your
opponent has. The game ends when the board is full.

Play
The first player begins the game as white. When the second player
takes his first turn, he may choose to change colors with white rather
than moving.

Each turn consists of 4 moves, some of which are optional:

* The player may move one of his stones one space horizontally or
vertically. Diagonal moves are not permitted. This first move is
optional.
* The player may again move one of his stones one space
horizontally or vertically. This stone may be the same stone as the
stone moved in step 1, but the player may choose to move a different
stone. This second move is optional.
* The player may move one of his stones one more time. Again, the
player may move one of the stones that has already been moved, or a
different stone. On this third move, the player may also pull, and
thus capture, one or more of his opponent's stones. This third move is
optional.
* Finally, the player must place a new stone of his color on the
board in any empty space. This fourth move is not optional.

To capture an opponent's stone, a pull mechanism is used. All pulled
pieces must be immediately adjacent, and in a straight line. If black
is pulling, only the immediately adjacent white pieces are pulled.
Once an empty cell, or another black piece is reached, the pulling
effect ceases. To pull, one stone of the player's color is moved to an
empty adjacent cell, and all of the opponent's pieces that were behind
that stone are pulled one step forward. Once pulled, the opponent's
stones are removed from the board and replaced with the pulling
player's stones. If Othello like pieces are used, the pieces may be
simply flipped to change their color. When pulling, there is not net
gain or loss with respect to the total number of stones on the board,
only the color of the pulled stones changes. The pulling stone stays
the same color.

When the board is full, if each side has an equal number of stones,
white wins.

Here's mine, Alea Evangelion: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110214094823/https://xifeng.posterous.com/new-as-yet--game">http://xifeng.posterous.com/new-as-yet--game</a>

The title is a terrible, three-way, three-language pun. I picked it
because the capture mechanic is kind of like Evangelism: one stone
converts all the stones around it.

The driving idea behind it was ko-fights in Go, though I can't know
for sure that such phenomena will be as prolific here as I hope.
Because of that inherently unstable phenomenon, there's a possibility
you could find yourself repeating the same sequence of moves over and
over again. In that case I've adopted a somewhat unorthodox
provisional rule: you must play a different move that breaks the
cycle, or continue spinning your wheels in stubborn defiance of the
rules of fun.

Enjoy,
Tristan

Hi Nick. Thanks for making this contest. It's had me thinking a lot
about flipping mechanics. I'm not a big fan of flipping games
normally because they tend to feel a bit random for me. Of course I
haven't tried them all (a gross understatement). I did however take
some time to work on a flipping game which I'm in the end phases
(hopefully!) of completing.

So far I have a few working rule sets that I'm slowly play testing
when I find time. I'd like to enter the contest, but I'm afraid that
although my winning condition appears to suit the mechanics of play it
doesn't fit the 1st requirement. The win for my game goes to the one
who has the largest group. Can I enter it in the contest anyway or is
that super important?

Not me. I am subscribed to this Google Group, but have never posted to
it, and am not involved in the abstract game contest.

I'm the Nick you're looking for! I think it best to keep a strict
adherence to the contest rules as written. But you should post your
game to this forum of course!

I have just finished my entry for the game competition. I'm not sure how
to make the file available to people, so I've just made it available on
the files section of the group page on google. It is a pdf file called
"mortars.pdf". The document is 7 pages long, but only the first 2.5
pages are specifically about Mortars. The rest is a brief description of
the Mortars and Screens family of games, of which Mortars is just one
specific instance. The description of the family depends on you having
read the rules for Mortars first.

I wonder if the description of the Family of Games would be better off
in a separate message, and I'm not sure where is best to make the file
available. I am in China, and so the link to Google's suggestions didn't
work since it points somewhere that appears to be behind the Great
Firewall, and I can only access that using devious means 9or by going
home to the UK, which I will be doing on 28 December for a month.)

Although I have entered the competition, it may be that I am unable to
take part in the judging, as I have major commitments when I am in the UK.

best wishes

Dawei.

ps: replies to the replies to my previous messages will dribble out over
the next few days now that I have some spare time.
