First about corners in Connection Games.

It strikes me again, as others have observed long ago,
that the standard basic games like Hex and Y do not even have
*slightly* special corners, if the game is so re-formatted.

So Hex, for example, 4x4, is just

         x x x
       . . . . o
    o . . . . o
   o . . . . o
  o . . . .
    x x x 

with these pre-set stones; and the task being
to join them up, in Atoll-like fashion.

Similarly in Y, the board starts with three rims of neutral colors,

     = . +
    = . . +     the task being to connect your group to all
   = . . . +    three neutral colors.
  = . . . .
     - - -

So, in both, the game can be re-presented without actual change,
in such a way as to avoid mentioning corners (or even sides!)
altogether. Whether this is worthwhile is a purely aesthetic
matter, but in some game servers the graphics would lend
themselves to this quite well, I think.

In Atoll, the game itself depends essentially on these pre-set
edge colors being there, to help effect connections, a feature
which adds that particular piquancy to the game that we fans love.

And the fact that the pre-set rims is essential in Atoll,
(and its higher-order extensions, as I mentioned once before),
suggests that it really "ought to be there" in the two basic cases,
Hex and Y, as well. From a mathematically inclusive PoV, at least.
And perhaps from a pretty-graphics PoV as well, as I said.

Removing any need to mention corners is thus just a helpful plus!
