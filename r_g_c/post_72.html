I have noticed a trend in new games' rules, that I rather like.
I don't suppose it is anything *really* new, but it shows up
rather particularly in a couple of new games, where it shines out.

The two games exemplifying this trend are Slither and Yodd.

And the feature that tickles me is this - in both these games,
there is a rule that prevents draws, and that could have been left
to the end of the game to enforce, in order to have its effect.
But in both games the draw-preventing end-of-game rule is deemed
to operate right throughout the game. This is excellent in that
it makes the rules more uniform and simple, and introduces
intriguing restrictions throughout the whole play, which can
be used for tactical effect.

In Yodd, the winner is the player who finally ends up with
the fewest separate groups. The rule to prevent draws is that
the players must finish up with an ODD combined total number of
groups; and to ensure this obtains at the end, the rule is that
it must obtain after *every* turn during the game. Cool!

In Slither, a rectangular version of Hex, draws are circumvented
by disallowing the final chain to have a diagonal-only connection
within it, and similarly to the above, this is most easily
achieved by insisting that after *every* turn there are
no such connections.

As I say, I rather like these "pre-emptive" anti-draw rules,
especially the simplifying fact that they are applied even
well before they are needed. Double cool!

If there are any other games with the same flavour, it would be
nice to here about them.

Original Ketchup worked that way: the goal is to have the largest
group at the end, and it is illegal to place stones so that your
largest group is equal to the opponent's largest group.

The new improved Ketchup 4.0 (perhaps sadly from your point of view)
changed that so that making a group equal in size to the opponent's
largest group is legal, and so ties in the largest groups are
possible, and they are resolved by looking at each player's next
largest group, and so on. :)

It is a funny coincidence. Last week, I was reminded me of Nick's
question of what the best abstracts of this decade are and his
later remark that we have seen some very good designs recently.

I checked my own mental list, it consisted of Unlur, Oust,
Slither, Symple, and Xodd*. Then, I noticed that Connect6 is
missing. It is not any way as old as it might be. And there
is a pattern.

In the course of history, abstract games have shied away
from any attempt at conflict simulation. The overwhelming
numbers of abbstracts boiled down to "I move, you move, I
move, you move..." - I will call that IMYV. There are many
abstracts in which you may not even pass.

Granted, some of the best games work that way, but that is
not all can build great games on. When we look at the games,
we see that Unlur begins with a contract phase. That goes
beyond "I move, you move".

Connect6 applies one of the most obvious diversions from
the IMYV, namely the 1-2-2... pattern to one of the oldest
families of games. And bingo, we have a winner. One of the
goals was to achieve balance with simple means. And yes,
Connect6 is balanced (caveat: 1-2-2... does NOT automatically
balance games) Among other things, Connect6 is more twisted
than in n-in-a-row games usually are. I like this because
I missed it in other games from the family.

Oust uses another known idea - you capture, you must move
again - coming from Dots and Boxes (historically another
strike of genius) - to a cold game and gets something very
good again.

Slither looks at a simple task - avoiding crosscuts - and
solves it by allowing more than one action per move. The
result, a connection game with movement and where you fill
in a board, is pretty close to the holy grail of game design.

Symple came out the interest in *Star, one of the few abstracts
which were deigned also with an eye to multi-move patterns. The
result is more a protocol than a game (SyGo is likely better).
Corey and I tested, if the protocol can be applied to Hex, and
it worked fine.

Xodd mixes two ideas, the 1-2-2... pattern and shared pieces.
The point is not to be fancy. To the contrary, it is essential
for the game. Very nice.

Add Ketchup and Chain Lightning to the list, and it is hard to
not see the pattern. IMYV is not all there is. Protocols are
as important as board sizes and grids.


There is a second pattern however. Quite a lot of these games
were developed in the "vicinity" of Iggamecenter. When we include
the other online gaming sites for abstracts, what else is left
but to say "Thank you" to their programmers?

Ketchup was invented at iggc. I was playing other games and chatting
with Arty one day, the idea occurred to me, and then we went to the
sandbox to test it.

This reminds me a bit of McLuhan's "The medium is the message".

A similar thing happened when the Zillions of Games community developed.
Many games appeared, back then, that were friendly to ZoG programming.

When such a specific medium for abstract games becomes popular, I
suppose it is to be expected that certain flavors of games (some of
those easier to model at that medium) also become more popular.

There are many instances of this principle at work. The first
abstract
board games were without board - think Nine Men's Morris - because
the
concept of a board had yet to be developed.

Another instance is the difference in representation of pieces for
Chaturanga family games between the West and the East. In the West,
pieces had different physical shapes (which add to the appeal, I
think, but I digress. On the other hand, good pieces were expensive
which confined Chess to certain classes). In the East, symbols on
physically similar items were were used, making pieces more readily
available. And it paved the way for Shogi's drops.
