 Dear Colleagues,
 
I'm pleased to announce that the deadline for submission to ACG 2021 is being extended to 20 September. Please do submit your interesting work. There will no further extensions to this deadline.

The Advances in Computer Games conference (ACG 2021) will be held online this year over 23â€“25 November 2021 (https://icga.org/?page_id=3086). ACG is an internationally renowned conference that publishes computer-based studies of games. Its history goes back to the inaugural event held in Edinburgh in 1975, making this the longest ongoing game AI conference. 
 
This yearâ€™s ACG will have a special track on The History of Computer Studies of Games. In addition to new work, we invite submissions that provide historical context or otherwise highlight key developments in game-playing programs and computer-based game studies over the decades. 
 
Keynote speakers will include: 
â€¢ David Silver (Google DeepMind) 
â€¢ Michael Bowling (University of Alberta) 
â€¢ Mark Lefler (Komodo, Zillions of Games) 
 
Conference attendance to view all talks will be free. 
 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
â€¢ The current state of game-playing programs for classic and modern board games, card games, puzzles, virtual/casual/video games, etc. 
â€¢ General game playing. 
â€¢ Artificial intelligence and machine learning for games. 
â€¢ The history of computers in game-based research. 
â€¢ New theoretical developments in game-related research. 
â€¢ New and enhanced algorithms for search and knowledge acquisition. 
â€¢ Automated game design and evaluation. 
â€¢ Social aspects of computer games. 
â€¢ Scientific contributions produced by the study of games. 
â€¢ Cognitive research of how (and why) humans play games and puzzles. 
â€¢ Capture and analysis of game data.
