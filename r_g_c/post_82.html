Last week, I had a strange dream. I was playing a game against
Nick Bentley, and during the dream, the rules of the game unfolded.

It is basically a variation of Sprouts. Yet, after moving, you may
mark closed areas - namely, either one closed area with two
marks or two areas with one mark. The one who has made the
most marks at the end of the game wins. Some reconstruction
after waking up indicates that is better to allow only to mark areas
in which no further move is possible. And I am not yet decided, if
a game ends if there are no moves possible anymore or if no
marks can be left anymore.

I am not saying this is a particularly good game. As a matter of
fact, I do not like scoring games that much. I just wonder what
it did in my dream. Ralf Gering wrote that one game came up
while he was dozing after lunch. I guess there are more games
like that out there.

I'm honored to have made it into your dream :)

I have many dreams about games, but I almost never remember the rules
upon waking.

This is remarkably similar to something I worked on and abandoned
during the development of Yusailo. I gave up on it because I thought
it too similar to Sprouts, as I had played it (you make only one mark,
in a region that you yourself close off.) Your rule may prove more
interesting, and I rather do like scoring games. I will probably play
around with this idea more.

My own game Watchtower is based on a game I played in a dream; I don't
think it's a particularly good game, but I'm pleased that I managed to
reconstruct it remembering only how it played, and not what the rules
were: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130228070111/http://beautifulenigma.posterous.com/pages/thea">http://beautifulenigma.posterous.com/pages/thea</a>

<i>Watchtower

Watchtower is an abstract strategy game that I played in a dream. Upon waking, I remembered none of the 
rules, only that it was a territory game that involved towers "seeing territory." Much thanks to Corey 
Clark for helping me reconstruct it.

Thea is played on a hexagonal grid of hexagons, like that used for Havannah, with stackable pieces of two 
colors. 4 or 5 hexagons to a side seems like the right size for now, even that size can lead to very long 
games, but the game is usually decided long before the board has been filled.

The rules are fairly simple. On a turn, you have three choices:

    Place a piece of your color on an empty space
    Place a piece of your color onto any tower you control
    Place a piece of your color onto any enemy tower that you threaten with a taller tower

A tower threatens all the spaces that can be reached by moving away from it exactly the distance equal to 
its height. These spaces lie on a hexagonal ring around the threatening tower. Note that a tower of 
height one threatens the spaces around it, but cannot attack them because no enemy tower could be shorter.</i>
