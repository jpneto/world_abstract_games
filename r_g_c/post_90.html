I've made a little change in the Quentin rules to make better use of the board while keeping the game drawless. In the revised version, a region is only a territory if all the points in it are adjacent to at least _two_ stones (instead of one in the first version). This effectively reduces the average territory size by half and makes counting easier.

It may seem that territories are now harder to spot, but actually the opposite is true, since, with this rule, they must always form a straight or zigzag line one point wide, without any ramifications. Also, territories crawling along an edge can't be bigger than two points, and corner points can't be part of any territory bigger than themselves.

You can even take advantage of the fact that most points in a territory are sandwiched by exactly two stones to speed up counting: if those two stones belong to different players, they needn't be counted. This wasn't often possible in the previous version because of the wider and more capricious territory shapes.
