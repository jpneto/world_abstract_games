Well, what did I tell you? Nobody cares. And if I had posted it
myself, it would for some members just have been a confirmation of
their idea that I'm a conceited old brat.

I discovered the symple mechanism a month ago or so and made four
games on it, six if you count translations, and four of these since
Nick announced the contest.

Are they all great games? No, not according to Mark Thompson's
definition, to which I subscribe.

Symple lacks drama, Charybdis has too much of it, Lhexus is
inconsequential.

But Sygo is another matter. I mowed the grass, put the ball on the
penalty spot, removed the keeper and and said "hey guys, put 2 and 2
together and you may have a great game.
But no-one was paying attention, fortunately, so I could invent it
myself before somebody else even saw the ball and the empty goal.

I'm an annoyingly talented reclusive and I rub people the wrong way
by doing what I do without much effort and without consulting,
trying, testing, talking and the like. Well, let me shade that: on my return I
did cooperate with Arty and David Bush, and I wasn't in the best of shapes
back then. Next Query, which is actually the closest thing to 'square hex, went
almost unnoticed.

Yet when I hear members say that they need at least six weeks, or that
they've been working on an idea 'for months', I can't help thinking "if you can't
find it in a day, you won't find it in a month either".
That's why I don't think much about games, usually. If I can't see my
prey, I leave it, and go walking with the dogs. If I see it, I hunt it
down. Bummer for the tedious diggers, but not my problem.

And that's why I only post in reply, should that not already be clear
from the lack of response your mirrored post about Sygo gets.
