For those who can manage to read about this game one more time without
retching, but I've found what I believe is another refinement. I won't
dwell on it, but I'm convinced it's better.

The idea: instead of giving the trailing player an extra stone on each
turn on which she trails, she now only gets an extra stone on turns
after her opponent creates or extends the largest group on the board.
The effect is to:

1. Shorten and liven-up the early/midgame, since it creates an
incentive to take the lead earlier (due to reduced negative feedback).
2. Creates a more varied decision-space in the late game, since now a
leading player has reason to occasionally avoid extending her largest
group in the late game.
3. Further shorten and clarify the rules.

I can't believe how much thought I've ended up putting into this
thing. I've learned that iterative design is nothing to scoff at. I
used to want games to pop out of my brain whole. This game could
*never* have popped out whole. The devil's in the details in ways I
couldn't have seen without lots of play testing.

Ok, the new rules:

Ketchup is a game for two players, played with red and green stones on
a hexhex5 or hexhex4 board.

Terminology
1. Group â€“ a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board.
2. Group Size â€“ the number of stones that a group contains. The
smallest possible group has a size of 1. The figure below shows three
groups with sizes 1, 3, and 12.
3. To Drop- to place a stone on any empty space.

Rules
1. The board begins empty. One player owns the red stones and the
other owns the green stones.
2. Red begins by dropping a single stone
3. From then on, starting with Green, each player drops two stones on
her turn.
4. If, on your turn, you create or extend a group larger than any
other on the board, your opponent may drop 3 stones instead of 2 on
his next turn (and only on his next turn).
5. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest
group wins. If the playersâ€™ largest groups are the same size, compare
their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which
aren't the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.

Incidentally, in versions where the two largest groups
may be of equal size, (thus including this latest),
there is a marginal COLD element in the game.

Has that been noticed before?

e.g. if both sides have equal largest groups,
with no 2nd-largest group, (so the board is almost
covered by the two huge blobs), and there are five
empty cells, scattered along the boarder, touching
both big lumps, then NO-ONE WANTS TO MOVE!

If moving is compulsory, (which the rules don't
make UTTERLY indisputable), then whoever moves
increases his group by two, then the opponent
increases his by three and WINS!!

TA-DAH. Freezing cold situation.

Yep! Although extreme cold situations like this don't come up in
actual play (or at least I've never played a game where it happened),
because cells adjacent to two oppositely colored big lumps are
important and get claimed earlier. There are, however, situations with
lesser degrees of coldness that pop up throughout.

Moves must be compulsory for the game to resolve unambiguously
(obviously), although perhaps I should allow for the option to add one
stone instead of two? There is at least one situation where you must
be able to add one stone instead of two, which is when there is only
one space left on the board. For the sake of consistency, maybe it's
best to allow for 1 or 2 stones per move at all times?

Any thoughts on the consequences, good or bad, of allowing for single-
stone drops? Do you think I should allow them?

If so, rule 2 should read:

"2. Red begins by dropping a single stone. From then on, starting with
Green, each player must drop 1 or 2 stones on her turn."

I'll change it if I can figure out whether it's a good idea.

I also noticed another issue in the way I've worded the rules that may
confuse people: it's not clear whether the first stone on the board
counts as "the largest group". It shouldn't. To make this clear, the
minimum group size should be changed to 2 instead of 1 in the
"definitions".

I'm not sure this is obvious to me. It looks like another
of those things that maybe "never seem to happen in preactice".

If so, I generally prefer non-compulsory moving, just to make
wording easier and to allow players slightly more choice and
thus maybe more skill. Not hot about it though.

Ditto. The more choice, the less compulsion/restriction,
the better, and more natural, IMHO. Within reason, OC;
it would not do for chess!

Well, only when the board is full can it be certain that at least one
pair of opposing groups are not the same size. As you say, it may not
matter in practice, but I like that draws are impossible, so I want to
the board to inevitably fill.
