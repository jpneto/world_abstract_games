Hi,

this is my potential candidate for the contest. I didn't playtest it
properly so it is possible I will change the rules partially or even
completely.

Pilf is played with two players, black and white, on a square board.
The board size is arbitrary, but a normal size could be 8x8. The game
requires two-sided pieces (as in Othello/Reversi), one side black
coloured and the other white coloured.


OBJECTIVE:
When a player doesn't have any legal moves then the game is over. The
winner is the player who has more pieces on the board.
Draws are not possible on boards with odd sides.


PLAY:
Players move alternately, starting from the black player.

There are two kinds of move:
1. short placement: one piece is placed (horizontally, vertically or
diagonally) adjacent to his own piece(s);
2. long placement: one piece is placed in any cell not (horizontally,
vertically or diagonally) adjacent to his own piece(s).

In his own turn the player can choose between making two short
placements or one long placement. Pass is not possible.

After each short placement (not after the long placement), all
opponent's pieces (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) adjacent to
the destination square are flipped, changing their colour. Flipping is
mandatory.

The game is quite changed:
- the board is hexagonal;
- just one move per turn;
- placement or movement are possible.

In this link there will be always the latest version of Pilf:

Anyway, I write the rules below.


* P I L F *

Pilf is played with two players, black and white, on a hexagonal
board. The board size is arbitrary, but a normal size could be 7x7x7.
The game requires two-sided pieces (as in Othello/Reversi), one side
black coloured and the other one white coloured.

OBJECTIVE:
When the board is full then the game is over. The winner is the player
who has more pieces on the board.

PLAY:
Players move alternately, starting from the black player. The pie rule
is used to make the game fairer.

In his own turn the player can choose between two different actions:
1. placement: one piece is placed in any unoccupied cell;
2. movement: one piece is moved to any adjacent unoccupied cell.

After a movement (not after a placement), all opponent's pieces
adjacent to the destination cell are flipped, changing their colour.
Flipping is mandatory.
