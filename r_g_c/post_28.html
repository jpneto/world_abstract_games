Hey All,

Nick's contest inspired me to think about flipping games so I had a go
at it. Unfortunately It doesn't fit the first requirement, but was
none the less an interesting exploration.

<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/89096/charisma">http://siteswapgeneration.com/games/Charisma/</a>

I suppose it fits in Cameron's current meme observation :)
Quite a few people helped with playtesting, ideas, and inspirations.

A sample game can be found here at the iggamecenter sandbox:
http://www.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?aid=17417&sid=157248&code=LONERU376

I hope to see a game at some point with 2 people at a high level of
strategy playing each other! If all works out right then there should
be quite a bit of drama in the game since comebacks were worked into
the design.

I added it to Arty's list of proposed games at iggc.
Now it just needs a bunch of thumbs up (hint/wink/nudge).
