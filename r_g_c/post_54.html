Nick was recently asking me what other games we played that had as goal,
to make something as large as possible, with the recursive extension that
if the two players had the same sized one, then the second-largest of
each player were to be compared to decide the winner, and if still
no decision, then 3rd-largest, and so on.

Innuendos aside, we call it "deciding by the largest group, recursively".

Here is a game we (Joao and I) have been playing for some time. I think
it's mentioned on his web site, but this is obviously the right time for
some publicity. The basic game is one move per turn, but in email
games we tend to play multi-move modifiers. This one is based on 12*,
that is, 1 2 2 2 2 ... moves successively. Any move may be passed.

The object of the game is to make the longest possible "snake" -
a wiggly but effectively-linear group of stones. (No branching.)

In all the games we've had so far, I don't think the 2nd-largest groups
have ever actually been called into judgment, but this current one
looks like it almost could - it just misses by a whisker I think.

____________________________________________________________

SQUIRM 12* group-restricted game 5 [B:3 J:1]
=========
DROP - On each turn, pass or drop 1 or 2 stones into empty cells.
The very first turn is restricted to one stone. When 2 stones
are dropped in one turn, they must finish up in disconnected
groups. (This is the "restriction" referred to above.)

SNAKE - A maximally-connected group of stones of the same color,
with each stone adjacent to either 1 or 2 friendly stones.

The very first turn is restricted to one stone. When 2 stones
are dropped in one turn, they must finish up in disconnected
groups. (This is the "group-restriction" referred to above.)

GOAL - Two successive passes ends the game. Whoever has the longest
snake wins the game. If these are equal, then compare the next
longest to decide the winner; and so on recursively.

Here is the game we are currently playing.
It will look better if you have a fixed-font option.

Above is the current situation.

The situation after move 2 is interesting:-

| bcdefghijklmnopqr    ___o_______x__
|     . . . . .     1. .. g4    i4 i6
|    . . . . . .    2. h5 h7    g6 l5

|    . . . . . .    8.

| bcdefghijklmnopqr

l5 was a definite blunder. It should perhaps have been at l7.

Of course x wants to make a "diamond connection" there, . x
because these are still unbreakable with the 12*(r) modifier:- x .

Unfortunately, the stone at i4 interferes with this, because x cannot
afford to link up there after o's nasty next k6, as this would make
a three-legged critter which would not count toward a win - a snake
may be wiggly, but it must be topologically equivalent to a straight
line.

The remainder of the game (so far) has been about x's efforts to recover
the situation by making a long snake anyway, with his southwestern stones.
Note that o cannot break the connection at f5 for the same reasons.
And even if x fails to make a longer snake there, he still has some
tiny chance of making a long snake in the north-east.

The game proceeds!

Interesting. Question: when I imagine playing in my head, I imagine
the first player opening in the center, and then extending outward in
two opposite directions from there, and I don't see what the second
player could do about it. Why does this not happen in practice?

This relates to the "current" state of the game above. On his last
turn, O played to the ends of his snake, rather than connecting across
the middle. From my naive understanding, it seems like the connection
across the middle would have been much better. What am I missing?

Firstly, o does not *need* to play in the centre, because x cannot
play there without utterly destroying his position. So o can wait
indefinitely to play there - he will do so in the end, of course.

Secondly, because of the group-restriction rule, it is not necessarily
a good idea to join up even strongly useful connections, because with
two separate "half-snakes", a double move can add one stone to each;
but with a single joined-up snake, only one stone can be added per
turn.

Of course, one cannot always afford to lazily lie back and wait
indefinitely, as in the above example. Some connections are urgent.
Each case must be decided on its own merits.

This is one of the surprising bonuses of the restricted-2-move
modifiers that we play so often. It is a fascinating area!

Ahhhhhh, there it is. I overlooked the group-restriction rule. Silly
me. Derp. Indeed, with that rule in place, I'm excited to give this
one a spin.
