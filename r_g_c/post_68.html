5 years ago I wrote an essay about a game called Zendo and posted it
to boardgamegeek.com. Because it's one of the more important things
I've written about games, I've been periodically editing it for years
(boardgamegeek tells me that I've edited it 48 times). It's now
different and better than it was when I first posted it, but it's also
buried deep in the bowels of the site where few see it. So I've
decided to republish it at my blog with additional modifications.
Enjoy:

Good essay. One of the basic problems of our society is that we never
quite learn how to think, nor do we seem to understand why it's so
important. I wish every mother, father and school teacher read your
essay and started to tackle this issue.

Amen.

Nowadays, with the internet, there are many resources about critical
thinking, and also some good books about it (eg, Morrow's "Workbook for
Arguments") But these resources are focused mainly for adults. I don't
know if there are some to use/play with children.

I wish I was able to find a list of nice and provocative questions that
could be (in)validated with simple experiments that kids could come up
with. Let me give you a very simple eg:

"A marble's color influences the time it takes to move through water"

This hypothesis could be presented to a kid, where he would need to come
up with some method to confirm it or invalidate it. Trying to solve the
problem would help to understand, in a practical way, many things about
the scientific method (and could be a good excuse to teach the children
lots of stuff).

A good list should, imho, focus on measurements (and its errors),
predictions, estimations, classifications, you name it.

Zendo does seems a nice game to simulate the scientific method (must try
it). However, and this may sound just nomenclature, let me add something.

When the Universe "creates a law", what we really have is the statement
of a new problem. Scientists can only create hypothesis given a
problem, and an hypothesis is basically a "educated guess in standby"
about that problem, which then induces a set of experiments in order to
confirm/refute it. After those experiments the scientist is more or less
confident to propose a thesis (no longer hypo-), a theory, a model of
the problem. And then we will see if the Universe has something to say :-)

Two things:

* A theory is a model, and so, always a projection, an approximation.
Can that idea be included in an advanced Zendo ruleset? Perhaps if the
Universe could only find a c.e.g much more complex that the tried
experiments, the game result would be a tie...

* The Universe could create a set of related laws or problems of
progressive complexity, which would produce a certain number of rounds
before the game was finished. The winning thesis could not contradict
the previous ones (usually, scientific models of similar problems should
not mutually contradict themselves). These might provide some
restrictions on hypothesis making (the well educated guesses are now a
product of previous experiments and known models) but could, eventually,
produce the reformulation of previous theories to conform with new and
more complex data. This would be something like a "paradigm shift".

Anyway, it's a very nice text, Nick. Congrats!

Interesting read. I like inductive games. I'm sure there are many more
great inductive games waiting to be discovered.
