With the holidays does anyone else think that 2 weeks might be too
short of time to try all of these enough to come to a conclusion?
That's 1 of each game per day if you exclude Christmas and New Years.
I worry that the effort that went into the games would be shadowed by
the lack of time that we have to play them all to an appropriate
level.

I'd be happy to extend it if others are cool with it.

Well, I am travelling back to the UK on 28 December, and will be busy
there until 8 February, when I return to Beijing, Consequently I'm
unlikely to have the time to play all the games anyway. So I won't be
voting. However, my opinion, for what it's worth, is that extending the
playing and evaluating period is not such a bad thing.

One other point I'm still a bit wary of: I couldn't save the
instructions anywhere other than in the filespace for this group, which
I see is going to be suspended from some date in the middle of January.
When I tried to save the game on the documents area of google, I got a
Russian language interface that I just could not alter. Since I cannot
understand Russian (it may as well be all Greek to me), I couldn't get
any further with that. I'm not sure how that arose, other than some
problem in the automatic detection of where one is posting from (I often
make use of VPN software to circumvent China's rather overly-cautious
Great Firewall, but removing that didn't seem to cause any difference. I
may try it on the PC I have in the UK, but it would be nice to have some
other means of storing documents on-line that can be made available to
all. I may see if I can sort out something on one of the websites I run.

Nick, I agree about extending the play-testing period.
