In response to a request to post our new game in fixed-font format, here we go...

It is a game that Joao and I came up with, based on Joao's
intriguing new idea of the "Sweetheart Modifier".
("Move modifier" is our term for meta move,
as mentioned in another thread. e.g. progressive, 1222, etc).

I include a partially-played example as illustration.
It appears to be the 8th instance we played.
I seem to have won the first 7!

If anyone wishes to challenge me (the world champ!) by email,
please do so. :)

(The board needn't be as big, OC, to start with.)

SWEETHEART Y [B:7] game 8
============
Y, with the following modifier.

On each turn the player plays a stone of his own, then (if possible)
an opponent stone next to one of the opponent's last-played stones,
then a stone of his own under group restriction.
First turn is one stone only, (no swap).

Comment after B2:

>> infiltration along the whole border!

These restricted multimove connection games are endlessly
intricate and fascinating.

I haven't followed the emergence of this game. Can you clarify "under
group restriction"?

Sorry - my boo-boo; it was in the original post that got mangled.

"Group restriction" just means that the two stones
you place during your turn, must end the turn still
as part of separate groups - a group being
a set of same-colour stones connected by recursive
adjacency. (This includes a single stone.)

Bill: can you comment on how it *feels* to play with this modifier, as
compared to other drop schemes? I'm having a tough time knowing
without playing.

OK, I'll answer a slightly different question from what you asked.

I'll comment, not on the sweetheart itself, but on the simpler
modifier of 12222... (i.e. 12* in finite language notation),
as applied WITH GROUP RESTRICTION to CONNECTION games.

So this would cover 12* Hex, 12* Y, 12* Atol, and so on;
the varieties are almost endless.

We have found that the 12*-restricted, which was
originally introduced more as just an equaliser,
(with the restriction inserted to prevent mindless extensions
of walls from Switzerland to the sea!), has appeared with
a strange and exciting dynamic all of its own!

The diamond connection, x . . is still completely viable
with the restriction, . . x .
so the games still look & feel quite a bit like plain connections,
BUT there is a 2nd-order effect, whereby these cannot be
endlessly chained.

For example, in this group,     . . . . . . . . .
which would be unbreakable       . x . . . . . .
in regular connections,           . . x . . . .
is no longer so in 12*, even       . . . x . .
under group restriction.            . . . . .

. . . . . . . . . Clearly O can place his 2 stones as shown,
 . x o . . . . .  and X cannot protect both diamonds!
  . . x o . . .   This leads to all sorts of dynamic
   . . . x . .    tussles as the two players try to
    . . . . .     balance attack, defense, and extension
in various different ways - there are
often two or three different battles going on simultaneously,
unlike usually just the one in regular connection games.

I strongly recommend just playing a few rounds of plain Y,
with 12* group-restricted, to get the feel of it.

Remember - I'm always up for email games with anyone
who wants to try! I'm all in favour of playing these things,
not just designing them! 12* restricted connection games are FUN.

> I'm having a tough time knowing without playing.

Wouldn't we all! Again I repeat there is no substitute
for actual play. Surely folk have a few minutes per day
to spare for some email games?!
............

As to the Sweetheart modifier specifically, it has all
the joys of the above, with some extra, rather more minor
wrinkles, involved in trying to get the best worth from
your opponent's forced gift to you. The adjacency rule is
crucial here, otherwise gifts could be just shoved away
uselessly into sharp corners.

I would, but I learned that I prefer playing in real time. I find
play by email to be frustratingly slow. Maybe I can change?
