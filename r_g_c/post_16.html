Just a quick update on the various formats of "Y".

As noted, the alternating stones around the edges just results in
exactly the same game as Y - not a new one. (I didn't acknowledge
this earlier because Christian F was getting bent out of shape by
that mild criticism of Havannah, and I didn't want to add fuel
to the fire!)

So it now seems that plain old "Y" can be re-formatted in no less
than 3, count them, THREE, ways. And no doubt there can be others
as well.

Original style:-


       .".      Task: connect the three sides.
      . . .
     . . . .
    . . . . .   Corners need a special mention in the rules.
   . . . . . .
  : . . . . . :


Bichromatic style:-

      x . o
     o . . x       Task: connect three of your original stones,
    x . . . o      one from each line.
   o . . . . x
  x . . . . . o    Neither corners nor sides need a special mention.
 o . . . . . . x
  . . . . . . . 
   x o x o x o


       - . =
      - . . =        Task: connect the three colors.
     - . . . =
    - . . . . =
   - . . . . . =     Neither corners nor sides need a special mention.
  - . . . . . . =
   . . . . . . .
    + + + + + +

Which you prefer is completely a matter of taste, the game is identical in all cases.

Bichromatic seems a bit ugly, though it has certain advantages;
but I'd like to see physical boards or game sites try
the trichromatic board - it could be very cute!
Five colors in total, with a 6th for the unplayed cells.
