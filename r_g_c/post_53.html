I've been playing with Mastermind.
One discovery: the 5-peg 7-color game can be solved with 6 guesses
maximum, though none of the "standard" heuristics find a way to do
it. Is this already known?

Google Groups seems to have frozen its Usenet archive.
I've no idea whether that's permanent, but since many Usenetters use
the Google interface, that may increase the popularity of groups like
this one.

Is that allowing repeated colors, or disallowing?

Does avyone know the figure for the "original" mastermind?
(4 pegs, 10 colors, no repeats)

Original Mastermind had 4 pegs and 6 colors, not 10 colors!
It has a 5-guess algorithm discovered by Knuth according to:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29

Deluxe Mastermind had 5 pegs and 8 colors.

Ah - I see I was thinking of "Bulls and Cows", which your article
references, and is much older though essentially the same,
which has 4 and 10, no repeats.

I recall we used to play it well before Mastermind was
(ridiculously unnecessarily!) commercially produced.

Repeated colors allowed. While Knuth's simple
algorithm happens(*) to find the min max-depth (4,6)
solution, it doesn't for the (5,7). Programmers
might have fun developing a heuristic that does
work (mine was brutish), And I'm curious if the
result is new. (One finds lots of info on the (4,6)
game on-line. For other games, not much.)

(* - Knuth and other algorithms use lexicographic
order as an arbitrary tie-breaker when choosing best clue.
But some other arbitrary ti-breakers fail to minimize.)

Yes, some commercial sets are silly, but at least a
Mastermind set has a little aesthetic appeal.
Playing Battleship on a set is masochistically tedious,
while paper and pencil is easy. Clue would be an exciting
abstract game, if you didn't try to incorporate board
and dice.

BTW, I plan to create a Mastermind-playing webpage using
Javascript's "Innerhtml." it will be my first real
venture into Javascript. Wish me luck!

OK then. I deliberately haven't read the article, but I managed
to outline a proof (to my own satisfaction) that (4,6)-no-repeats
could be achieved in that minimum; now I will have to embark on
the more tediously laborious repeats-allowable version. Damn!

I generally don't like the repeats-allowed versions,
for two reasons.

1) I was introduced via "Bulls and Cows", where the no-repeat rule
was standard, and developed cool pencil-and-paper techniques for
playing well. So I selfishly dislike to change.

2) The repeats-allowed version is much harder to keep track of
during a pencil-&-paper game. And harder in a bad way - it just
adds complications without adding much depth. And this is not
merely subjective:- I found that the rules used by servers
seem to be rather illogical - they are not purely numerical,
but involve a certain "human-oriented" aspect. This is borne
out by the fact that they are annoyingly difficult to program -
it can be done, but a simpler purely-numerical rule would make
it so much easier even to get a computer to *play* the game!

So, I haven't done much on servers, though I consider myself
one of the best (at no-repeats). BOOOOOOoooooooo....!!!

> Clue would be an exciting abstract game,

Yes indeed! I think "Clue" is the American name for our "Cluedo";
Colonel mustard, hammer, rope, conservatory etc - right?

Cluedo is very clearly a pure card game (distantly similar to
"Go Fish" or "Happy Families"), that has been filled out with
commercial rubbish like a board and tokens of various types,
wonderful for having something to actually *sell*, but revolting
excrescences to us who prefer pure games over excressential ones.
<copyright!> ;-)

Pure Cluedo is simple, an interesting search game; one only needs
to have (3 or) 4 suits, unsightedly conceal one of each, deal out
the rest, and ask and show as in Cluedo. It is so "natural"
a game that I keep trying to get urban peasants to try it out,
without any success so far - they just LOVE their tokens!

Though oddly, they are quite happy to play Happy Families with
ordinary cards, which is also a serious intellectual multiplayer game.

Good luck, bon chance, and mucho feliz! You are a hero! :)

I've always assumed repeats add a nice complexity, but
I've never played "Bulls and Cows." I used to play Jotto
quite seriously, a Mastermind-like game where secrets and
probes must all be English 5-letter words.

Right. One draws inference from others' probes, but may be
victimized by their "bluffing" so it might be a much deeper
game than expected. I suggested it for a programming contest
once, but was met with bafflement....

It's ready for a first look: http://fabpedigree.com/james/mmind/

It still needs some user-interface tuning, but is
available for early bug reports!! :-)

And right off the bat I spot an obvious confusion.
To get the computer to start querying, you click "Set your secret."
the only "setting" you need actually do for your secret is to
write it down on paper (where the computer can't see it!)
