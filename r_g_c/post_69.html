Does anyone have any ideas about a good strategy for Slither?

I've been playing it for a while, but still have no ideas about it,
it almost seems as random as Reversi!

Any comments much appreciated.

I have some ideas but I have a losing record so I'm not sure they're
any good. There's a player at iggc who goes by the handle Maraaca,
who, with a record of 41-3, is far and away the best Slither player. I
would love to convince him to write about his approach. Does anyone
know this fellow or how to contact him?

Presumably some of the strategies for other connection games apply to
Slither (e.g. place your pieces efficiently, don't commit too soon,
control the center). The slither move adds a new aspect, though. It
seems to me to serve two functions: 1) it gives the opportunity to
"correct" slight tactical errors 2) it allows you to build a dynamic
rather than static attack. The logical implications of function #2 is
that you have more attacking options to work with, as well as an
increased ability to "sacrifice" pieces (i.e. force your opponent to
close off certain potential connections) in building an attack.

As a tactical matter, I've noticed that it is usually
a bad thing to put two of your own stones in
alignment with one space between them. This invites
the opponent to wedge in between, and it is theen usually
diffi cult to impossible (depending on what's nearby)
to get you stones connected again!

So in extending from a stone into new(ish) territory,
it pays to stretch to 2 spaces in between, if you
want to stay in the same line.

Any other useful tips?

P.S. It IS a damn cool game!

This has always seemed like an *easy* thing to do. Since you can move
one of your two original stones diagonally in the direction of the
other, and then add a stone to make a corner between them. Am I
missing something?

Maybe he's referring to two groups of arbitrary size, rather than two
stones:

. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
x x x o x x x
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .

. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
x x . o x x x
. . . x x . .
. . . . . . .

The two groups are still disconnected, and I doubt that there is a
forced local sequence which connects them.
