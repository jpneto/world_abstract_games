Normally I copy posts from my blog to this forum, but this one has
figures which are hard to describe, so this time I'll just refer you
to the original post:

In short: I've got a new game called Clots which I designed while
thinking about the weaknesses of my game Ketchup.

Looks good! I'll have to start up some email games
with Joao, to try to find the best sizes and sections etc.

I was intrigued to note that you were partially inspired
by Steere's horrible "Fractal" board, (which would have
been better named Escher, BTW, but no matter).
The sections idea is a much better way to "sludge up"
the centre, however.

Indeed, as you note, it is more of a rule *modifier*,
than a rule in itself - most games, perhaps even chess
or Go, can use it, because in most games it is an advantage
to bag the centre first. So, great new modifier!

Thanks,

Mind you, I'm not sure it works, but it's something to play with
anyway. I agree that fractal is not so good. I played it a couple of
times and it felt awkward. Like many of his games, the concept is
neat, but the experience of playing is not.
