This forum is a bit dead no? To spice things up and out of curiosity,
here's a question, of the desert island variety:

Among games which

1. ...were invented this century; and
2. ...were not invented by you,

Which is your desert island game?

For me it would be Slither (aka Particle Bond). I can't believe it
hasn't gotten more acclaim. All the formal beauty of Hex, but the
connections break and reform in a totally arresting way as the game
proceeds, leading to sudden changes of fortune and impossibly
delightful tactics. No description can do it justice though. You have
to play it to see.

There are similar connections games on Hex boards, but they're not
nearly as good as this square board game. The square board and
orthogonal-only connections are key.

For me it would be Go. At the customs house in the not-so-desert
island, I would hide it so that the agent doesn't confiscate it for
being older than 1900.

But, as there would be too much time to spare on a desert island, I'd
take Realm too. I haven't played it, so my impressions are absolutely
superficial, but I remember that when I first read the rules it seemed
to me like a very original game, quite different from the typical
abstract with all too familiar mechanics. It almost felt like a
computer strategy game, if you know what I mean. I don't know if
gameplay corresponds to these expectations, but it'd be fun to find
out in those slow afternoons, between cleaning the straw shack and
hunting a wild boar for dinner.

Slither is great, but I usually prefer territory games to connection
games. What about a mix between Slither and Reversi Go? The movement
of pieces may well serve as a pretty natural eye-opener, just as the
multiple drops in Sygo. Just off the top of my head.

I took him to mean less than 10 years old, since he said "this
century" rather than "in the last century". I'm honestly having a hard
time thinking of a game that young that has really captured my
imagination (even Arimaa is from '99!). I think that of the games
invented this century, or even in the last century, Cephalopod is the
only one that has really held my attention, but I'm not convinced yet
of its lasting merits, because it has some elements that I find
troubling.

I was interested in it for the same reasons, but it appears to have an
overwhelming 2nd move advantage, first player has won something like
12% of the games on Super Duper. It's not exactly a profound sample,
but I found that statistic discouraging, and I can see in the rules
some things that would support such an imbalance.

Then I'll say Homeworlds (from 2001; I enjoy it a lot, and then I'll
have the pyramids to play many other combinatorial games as well! :)

The ideal desert island games are Mancalas. You do not have to
take them with you, you can play them literally on the beach.
Some worthy contenders from the Mancalas have been invented in
the period mentioned, but when the game police is not watching,
I would try to find somebody who I can teach Hawalis.

Other than that, there are no desert island games, there is
desert island equipment consisting of boards, stones, and what
have you. The equipment gives the opportunity to play many
games. I would not go for the hexboards that are so popular
at the moment but rather for an old fashioned go-bang or even
a checkered 10x10 board (after all, you can use them for games
on smaller boards).

The next question is what is meant with this century. If it
means the last century spanning from the invention of Lasca
to the games of 2011, my decision would be Hex. No single runner
up comes even close. It is a breakthrough design with amazing
gameplay - one of the best games in history.

If "this century" is referring to 21st century, then it is
not clear whether 2000 is part of the 20th century or the 21st.
An old German law says that the century starts with the 00 year.
So, if 2000 is part of the 21st century, I will go for Dameo.
Dameo aims at no less than being the better Checkers and it
succeeds.

However, if 2000 is out, there are many fascinating games to
choose from. Usually, they are pretty abstract even for abstracts.
I would still go for another Freeling game from the Symple family,
likely SyGo.

Slither is a very good game. If anything, it feels like too much
of a fight. I did not expect to say that about a game, so it is
quite a compliment.

Clearly, I should have been less ambiguous. Upside is that I have more
answers now. FWIW, I meant 2000 till now, inclusive.
