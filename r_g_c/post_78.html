Nick said:

"The lack of strategy is the most difficult issue to fix so I start
with that. Morro creates strategy through negative feedback. Negative
feedback here refers to a penalty for taking the lead or getting
closer to the win condition. In Morro, when you take the lead, your
opponent gets a stone advantage.

It's the opposite of "the rich get richer" dynamic. With negative
feedback "the rich get poorer": sometimes taking the "lead" is a bad
idea. As a result the players have to take the long view and play
toward the endgame, rather than focus just on taking the lead. Voila.
Strategy."

Your thoughts about the relationship between negative feedback and
possible increased strategy are interesting. It occurs to me that
your comments might also be relevant to games where significant parts
of the board are cold, such as most Checkers variants, as well as my
revised version of Forms. I will have to think further about this.

This is just about the most fundamental aspect of modern abstract game
design. Introducing an element of coldness to a game is the only way
to truly obscure turn order advanatage in a completely symmetric
abstract.

Certainly an important one.

But it must be coldness in sub-goals, like Morro, not coldness
in moves, which I find very distasteful, at least in games
which have a clear achievement goal.

Is that so? I am inclined to believe it, but I would like to see
a compelling argument.

Games which are trivially drawn, such as Tic Tac Toe, are an
exception to the rule. Many other games have been proved to
be a draw, but usually the first player has an advantage in
practical play. My question is now whether all the non-trivial
games in which the first player does not have (much of) an
advantage have cold aspects to them?

hehe, you got me, TECHNICALLY, still without coldness its a first
player win until its a perfect draw. Now I have entertained this idea
of a deep strategic game where at the very top echelon of grandmasters
the gameplay results in a perfect draw. Nick described this as a
"grail" of abstract game design for him and I agree it would be quite
a feat to design such a game. However, let's be realistic, you'd have
to possess supernatural prescience that would make the prescience of
Christian Freeling look like a groundhog seeing its shadow. With our
current limited understanding of how abstracts work this is a chimera
but the other thing is I'm skeptical the draw margin is even
necessary. Let's say this very small draw margin were to be
reconsolidated into a first or second player advantage, we would still
have a very balanced game but one that is more decisive, at the very
least then its just a matter of taste. I wouldn't personally prefer
one over the other, like I said I don't hate games with draws.

Its pretty obvious how zugzwang obscures turn order advantage. If
there are turns where you're compelled to reduce the value of your own
position, the opponent's initiative isn't the only factor hindering
your pursuit of the objective therefore even with perfect play the
game may result in a second player win.

Isn't this already true of Checkers? For most players the game
produces a result, but for a perfect player (e.g. Chinook) then the
game is a draw against other perfect players. This may not be true of
human grandmasters as they're not quite perfect players.

I don't know your opinion of Checkers, but it strikes me that such a
tendency towards drawishness is not necessarily a good thing in a
game.

The "grail" I mentioned to Corey is a game with one single drawn
state; i.e. a single draw node on the game tree, which would be
reached with perfect play.

In principle it's possible to construct a game like this, for example
by arbitrarily designating a single state in the "perfect play" path
of a no-draws game. You can do it on a small hex board for example,
but I'm not looking for something so artificial.

So add the constraint that the single draw node has to have something
natural about it. Not that I even know what that means. Maybe some
kind of visual symmetry?

Anyway, checkers obviously isn't an example.

Precisely, Checkers isn't good enough, you can get draws at low level
play you can get them at high level play in this hypothetical game you
can only get a draw between very experienced players and this draw
margin is otherwise not going to come up in practice.

Well, that immediate remark was in response to a comment about Morro,
which is a good example. Because of the sub-goal negative feedback,
it is often a good diea NOT to make a new longest line, so that's
what I'd call coldness in subgoal, as one does eventually want
to make the longest line!

But OC there's never coldness in moves in Morro - it's always
good to have another move, one never wants to pass.

And that, BTW, makes an excellent definition of coldness in moves,
without any fancy talk about values and so forth: if one NEVER
wants to pass, it is a hot game, if one would sometimes want
to pass, it has a cold element.
