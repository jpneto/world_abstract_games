Many years ago, there was a post to sci.math concerning a Mancala
style situation. I don't recall whether or not the main query
was fully answered, but I thought it worthwhile to post again.

There are a fixed number of beads distributed into a number of
cells arranged in a circle, and on any move, the player may pick up
the contents of any inhabited cell and distribute them anticlockwise
around the circle, one in each cell. If there are as many or more
beads in the chosen cell than there are cells, the chosen cell is
refilled as well, and distribution continues with extra beads
going into the next several holes. (This is in distinction to all
traditional Mancala games I know of, where the chosen cell is
passed over and left empty - but the mathematical puzzle tries
to allow for the possibility that any arrangement might be
achieved by some move or other from some preceding position).
OC if there are a huge number in the chosen cell, two or
even more full circuits could be made.

For ease of keyboarding, we write the cells in a line, with
distribution from left to right, recalling that going out over
the right-hand end means coming back in on the left. So e.g.

3 4 - 7 1 (15 beads in 5 cells) would go to

- 5 1 8 1 if the 1st pile was chosen,
4 - 1 8 2 if the 2nd pile was chosen,
5 5 1 1 3 if the 4th pile was chosen, and
4 4 - 7 - if the 5th pile was chosen.

The main query is:

* Given any two distributions with k beads and n cells,
* does there necessarily exist a sequence of moves that
* takes the first position to the second?
