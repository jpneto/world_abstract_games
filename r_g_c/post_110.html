Hi All,

I'd like to announce an upcoming special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games (T-CIAIG) on "General Game Systems":
http://csee.essex.ac.uk/tciaig/sis/ggs.pdf

If you work on software for playing, evaluating and/or generating general games, we'd love to hear from you.

Regards,
Cameron

CALL FOR PAPERS

General Game Systems


IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games (T-CIAIG)

Special issue: General Game Systems

Special issue editors: Cameron Browne, Nathan Sturtevant and Julian Togelius


General game playing (GGP) involves the development of AI agents for playing a range of games
well, rather than specialising in any one particular game. Such systems have potential benets
for AI research, where the creation of general intelligence remains one of the open grand challenges.

GGP was rst proposed in the 1960s and became a reality in the 1990s with the Metagame system 
for general Chess-like games. The specication of the game description language (GDL) and
annual AAAI GGP competitions followed in the rst decade of this century, providing a platform
for serious academic study into this topic. The recent advent of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
methods has allowed the development of truly competitive GGP agents, and there is exciting new
research into applying GGP principles to general video games.

The eld of general games research is now becoming fully rounded, with the development of
complete general game systems (GGS) for playing, analysing and/or designing new games. These
include not only GGP, but also any system that attempts to model a range of games; the denition
is itself kept deliberately broad. The key feature of such systems is their generality, but the issue
of representation remains an obstacle to true universality while they rely on formal descriptions
of target domains.

The purpose of this special issue is to draw together the various research topics related to AI and
CI in general games, to give an indication of where the eld currently stands and where it is likely
to head. It will explore questions such as: How good and how general are existing systems, and
how good and how general can they become? What have we learnt about AI and CI from studying
general games? How do we apply existing GGP expertise to general video games? We invite high
quality work on any aspect of general games research in any genre of game -- digital or physical --
including play, analysis and design. Topics include but are not limited to:

* General game playing
* General game description and representation
* General game design and optimisation
* Generalised Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) approaches
* Real-time, nondeterministic and imperfect information extensions to GGP
* General video game playing
* Framing issues and constraints on generality
* Bridging the gap between academic and commercial applications

Authors should follow normal T-CIAIG guidelines for their submissions, but identify their papers
for this special issue during the submission process. Submissions should be 8 to 12 pages long,
but may exceed these limits in special cases. Short papers of 4 to 6 pages are also invited. See
http://www.ieee-cis.org/pubs/tciaig/ for author information.

Deadline for submissions: May 3, 2013
Notification of Acceptance: July 5, 2013
Final copy due: October 4, 2013
Publication: December 6, 2013
