Thanks for the updates Nick - much appreciated.

I must say I'm surprised at your report whereby
a large proportion of games turned out to be
equal on largest-sized groups! Joao and I have
been playing it for a little while, and have never
had a single one, nor had a game that even
*threatened* to come down to that!

So I deduce that you and your opponents must be playing
a somewhat different approach from ours! - that it should
happen so often with you. This is puzzling, as your games
that were recorded on your site, (great graphics BTW!),
seemed to start very similarly to ours.

This makes me even more keen to play some email games with you,
that might give us a chance to see what's what.

Any chance of that?
