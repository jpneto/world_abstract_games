Dear Recre.Games.Combinatorial Members,

The Digital Ludeme Project (DLP) is proud to announce the Ludii AI Competition 2022! 

This year, a total prize of â‚¬9,000 is funded by the PaRis Artificial Intelligence Research InstitutE (PRAIRIE). The winners of the three competition events will receive a prize of â‚¬3,000 each. The competition will happen during the 25th Computer Olympiad.

Details about the competition can be found here: https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAICompetition

The Ludii AI Competition is a General Game Playing competition focussed on developing agents that can play a wide variety of board games. The events will use Ludii (https://ludii.games/), a general game system, to provide the necessary games and API. Games will be provided in the Ludii (*.lud) game description format. The version used for this competition (1.3.2) of Ludii includes over 1,000 games.

How to Register?

To participate in any of the tracks, please send us an email at ludii...@gmail.com to register. The required information is your first and last name, the name of your agent, and an email to contact you. Registration is free.

This competition is also a good opportunity for students (PhD, Master or Bachelor) to experiment with AI techniques and apply them to games. So please, if you know anyone who might be interested, spread this announcement.

The three competition events are:
1. Kilothon: Best utility obtained on more than 1,000 games against UCT. This track can already be run right now on your machine, please check the competition page.
2. General Game Playing (GGP): Competiton on games present or not in our library.
3. Learning: A set of games are announced months before the actual competition, the agents are invited to learn before competing.

Important Dates:
â€¢ March/April 2022: Learning track games will be announced over March and April.
â€¢ February-July 2022: Agents can be run for the Kilothon track any time over February to July.
â€¢ End of July 2022: The GGP and Learning events will be run during the 25th Computer Olympiad (http://icga.org/) around the same dates as IJCAI 2022 (https://ijcai-22.org/). Announcement of the winners will be made afterwards.
