This popped into my head last night. I haven't tested it (as is so
often the case these days), so it may be more an illustration of an
interesting concept rather than a good game (but who knows!). Plus it
also has a colorful board. So check it out.

Sorry Nick, I didn't quite follow the swap rule.

Is the rule that a swap can be done on ANY turn in the game,
provided that it follows a move in a new most-interior ring?

P.S. That really IS a festive board! :-)

Can't say much without having played it, but the underlying idea (as I
see it), that better spaces on the board should be more difficult to
get, is a good one. In that respect, it reminds me a bit of conhex and
aronda. Also like aronda, play would likely proceed from the outside
in.

The issue I see with swaparound seems to be that while there is the
potential to change colors five times, I'm guessing it would probably
only happen once or twice, in which case it just amounts to a player
getting to go twice in a row. And what if someone plays the first move
in the center? Then after a swap, you're just playing Y on a different
board.

Still, it's an interesting idea and I'd like to see how it actually
plays.

Bill: answer to your question: yes. So, there is a maximum of 5 total
swaps on a hexhex5 board. My experience is that games where you
switch sides more than once are opaque, which is why it's probably not
a good game. Still haven't played it though.

jfpierce: right. The idea was to make central moves balanced with
outside moves. In this case, probably too balanced.

If someone plays that first move in the center, they're not playing
very well. That's a devastating move in this game and would surely be
swapped.
