This is an almost-repost from 2.5 years ago,
on various presentation formats for "Y".

It seems that plain old "Y" can be re-formatted
in no less than 3, count them, THREE, ways.
And no doubt there can be others as well.

Original style:-

     .".      Task: connect the three sides.
    . . .
   . . . .
  . . . . .   Corners need a special mention in the rules.
 . . . . . .

Bichromatic style:-

     x . o
    o . . x      Task: connect three of your original stones,
   x . . . o     one from each line.
  o . . . . x
 x . . . . . o   Neither corners nor sides need a special mention.
o . . . . . . x
 . . . . . . . o

Trichromatic style:-

     - . =
    - . . =       Task: connect the three colors.
   - . . . =
  - . . . . =

Which you prefer is completely a matter of taste,
the game is identical in all cases.

Bichromatic seems a bit ugly, though it has certain advantages;
but I'd like to see physical boards or (ESPECIALLY!) game sites
try the trichromatic board - it could be very cute!
Five colors in total, with a 6th for the unplayed cells.

I prefer the trichromatic board, as it's the one that makes it clear how to generalize the game to other boards. Plus colors are pretty.

Both good points!

And you're very right about pretty. :)
