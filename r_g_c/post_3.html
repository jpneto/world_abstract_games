Hi all,

Nice to be here, at this new home for the abstract landscape of games.

I think this deserves something special and so, in the next link, you
all may download a digitalized book made by Fred Horn and presented at
the last Board Game Studies (in Paris).

This book is a collection of articles from the late english magazine
Games and Puzzles, concerning abstract games. A true rarity after more
than 30 years.

Cheers,

Fred Horn then. I had the pleasure of meeting him on this year's congress
of game authors here in GÃ¶ttingen. He introduced me to his game Fianco
(http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/fianco.htm - note the uncanny resemblance
to Dan Troyka's later game Breakthrough) as well as a variation on 4 in a row
played with pieces made up of two cubes. He also gave a self-designed card
set out to other designers, challenging us to come up with a game within a
year.

Later, I met Niek Neuwahl who has designed a large collection of three dimensional
abstracts. It took me some time realise that he is the guy behind Aztec. To be
precise, it did not dawn on me until I arrived at home (if you are reading this, Niek,
sorry). As opposed to Fred, he also won at his own games always. 

These two were islands in a sea of designers who where hoping to get publishers
interested by sticking a theme onto their rarely stringent ideas. I talked with
several of them and they told me that publishers demand first and foremost
that there is a theme. Well, Fred and Niek did not care. There were a few others,
but these two were entirely abstract.

And that brings me to an observation. Christian Freeling, Fred Horn, Niek Neuwahl,
and Kris Burm are Dutch respectively Dutch speaking. Why is there such a number
of abstract designers speaking Dutch?

I see two explanations:

The Dutch are good at English (and German, I can assure you) which helps
them to access a large market. For some time in my life I believed there were
few, if any designers in Romanic countries. This belief is likely an effect of them
not passing the language barrier (that used to include you, Joao, too).

A second assumption is that Checkers is still going strong in the Dutch culture
whereas other cultures moved on to supposedly higher and better games. Checkers
is a simple, yet clever and deep game. The current market is looking for simple
and clever games, if they have an obvious twist. The latter is missing in Checkers,
but the Dutch are willing to cope.

There's also Martin Medema (Atlantis, Explocus, conceived the concept
of the China Labyrinth). Horn is an expert and collector, like you,
Neuwahl doesn't sound very dutch, but I believe you, and Burm is only
in it for the money (implying no value judgement, I just stopped at
Gipf ;-)

So that's 5, and I don't think it means anything. Certainly not in my
case, because barring Martin they all might have lived on the moon
(although I _think_ I met Horn once, far away in the last century).
