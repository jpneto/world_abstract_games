    <div class="content">
I just came across an old article of mine from rec.games.go,
while sorting through old files. It was about "Bidding Go".
Maybe I'll update and post it here in due course, but I was
wondering about bidding-for-moves in general.

The idea is, OC, that moves on the board do not necessarily
alternate between the two players, but that in each turn, they bid for
the right to move, the higher bidder giving the other that many
units to the other, and then moving. It really only applies to games
where one typically wins by a measurable whole-number amount,
so that the size of the bids has some significance. It can hardly
apply
to out-and-out battle games like chess and checkers, which are
purely win/loss/draw. (This means that bid-allowable games have
an automatic "handicap" option as well, as in golf!)

Go, is, OC, the ultimate and prime example of a biddable game.
The win is not merely a win, but a win by a certain amount of
territory. So a player who wins on the board might still lose
over all, if he has spent much more than his opponent on bids.

My question really is, I guess, what other games are near this idea?

Other standard games that have a "countable winning margin",
include Reversi, Backgammon and Wari. What else?

There are a number of recently composed games here the winner
is the one who finishes up with the largest connected group,
or perhaps with the longest moku-line. These would appear to be
of this type, as the difference in sizes is a clear, observable,
integer amount, amenable to bidding-unit comparison. This would
be even more so if the currently popular "recursive scoring",
(whereby if the biggest groups are equal the 2nd-biggest
are looked at and so forth), were extended appropriately.
Maybe triple points for the biggest, double for the second,
single for the third, or whatever seems appropriate.
[note:] This multi-scoring option could also be played in
the alternating game OC, not just the bidding version.

What other games are like this? At a pinch, I suspect connection
games could be, Hex Y etc, where the winning "score" is the number
of extra moves it would take the loser to connect, counted just
before the last move were made. A bit artificial, but possible.

Any other known games that have a "countable winning margin"?

Omega: score is the multiple of your group sizes. Calculating all
possible scores looks like it may be combinatorially explosive for
larger board sizes, but Nestor has a nice proof that the maximum score
is given by having all groups as close to size 3 as possible.

Abande has an original scoring rule.

In checkers, you could count the number of pieces the winner has at
the end of the game.
