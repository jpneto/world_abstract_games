Here's my submission for the contest...

DEVIL'S ADVOCATE

Basic rules:
Players alternately place one stone at a time in an empty space on a
board with an odd number of hexagonal cells. Normally, Black may only
place white stones, while White may place either white or black
stones. If the placement of a white stone completes one or more
unbroken rows of four or more white stones, all stones in these rows
flip to black. When the board is full, the player with more stones of
their color on the board wins.

Balancing stones:
On most standard boards, White has a small but definite advantage.
Rather than using boards which cannot easily be displayed in iggc's
sandbox, it is suggested to give Black a limited number of black
stones which may be played at any time during the game in place of
their usual white stone. Though a 'pie-rule' arrangement can ensure
that both players agree on the appropriate number of such stones, CPU
self-play suggests the following setups as fair, and the 9x9x9 is
particularly recommended.

6x6x6 Black gets 5 black stones, white gets first move.
7x7x7 Black gets 4 black stones and first move.
8x8x8 Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.
*9x9x9* Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.
10x10x10 Black gets 2 black stones and first move.

Notes: It's a bit on the tactical side for my own tastes, and I often
found myself wishing I could tweak the rules of the contest rather
than those of the the game. Even though they're effectively
equivalent, I'd prefer to change the number of stones required for
victory rather than adding the extra black stones. Of course it would
be better still if the manual balancing weren't necessary at all, but
the only boards I found which accomplished this were either
ridiculously large, or involved wraparound which would be more easily
visualized with more help than the sandbox readily offers. Note that
once one accounts for the balancing stones, players may mark cells
which can no longer be flipped as white, since Black may not play a
black stone there, and White should never choose to.

I don't have much in the way of personal webspace, and I spent more
time on the program than making pretty pictures, so I guess I'll just
link back here, barring any objections.
