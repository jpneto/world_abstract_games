Reposted from blog:

When I'm busy, I sometimes post rules to games I've invented without
testing. The results usually lack...uh...any redeeming qualities.

One such game, which I posted a few months ago, is called Morro, the
product of my desire to design an N-in-a-row game which is strategic,
drawless, and balanced (most N-in-a-row games are tactical and have
problems either with imbalance or draws, and they also bore me)

Against the odds, Morro has given me more food for thought than I
expected it to. So now I bloviate. First the rules:

Morro is a game for two players on a square grid (I recommend 7x7 to
start) with white and black stones.

Definitions:

1. Row: any line of consecutively adjacent, like-colored stones. Rows
may be oriented either orthogonally or diagonally. The length of a row
is the number of stones in it.
2. Drop: to place a stone on any empty space.

Rules:

1. To start, White drops a single stone.
2. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn, you must drop a number of stones equal to the length of the
longest row (of either color) on the board. If there aren't enough
empty spaces left to do so, just fill up the board.
3. When you create a row longer than any row created by your opponent
up until that point, you become the leader.
4. The game ends when the board is full, and the leader at that time
wins.

When I first posted the rules, I got several messages to the effect
that this would probably be a dumb mess, and I agree that the rules
sort of suggest as much on first glance. But it's not what it seems.

What's it about?

The first key to understanding Morro is recognizing that both players
often have an incentive to avoid taking the lead, or build long rows.
Why? Let's say you're the first player to build 2-in-a-row. Up till
then, you and your opponent have been going along placing one stone
per turn. But when you build a row of two, your opponent gets to place
two stones on his next turn. Because he gets first crack at placing an
extra stone, he now has a little material advantage. Every time you
retake the lead, you give a little material advantage to your opponent
(Morro's similar to my game Ketchup in this way). Of course, you have
to take the lead sometime, so the material advantage you give away
becomes increasingly subsidiary to positional issues as the game
proceeds.

So, what do you do in the early game instead of trying to take the
lead? You place stones so that, in the endgame, your opponent won't be
able to form long rows, but you will. I call this "clogging the
lanes". It involves carefully spacing your own stones (for example,
spacing your stones a chess knight's move away from each other seems
to be important) and noting that the midpoint of each column and
diagonal on the board is important: by placing a stone at the midpoint
of a column you cut in half the longest row your opponent can build in
that column.

But then your opponent's stones get in the way and therein lies the
game's interest.

I hope this game turns out to be good, because some of it's formal
features are nice. It's drawless, and I believe balanced even on tiny
boards due to a cold element - the game is more about timing and
position than about material. And the rules are simple.

In one sense, the game is a success because it doesn't revolve around
the same tactical look-ahead as other n-in-a-row games. That was my
original motivation in designing it.

On the other hand, the jury's out about another possible problem. It
turns out that Morro is hard. Try figuring out who has a forced win on
a 5x5 board to see what I mean. I still have no idea. I've discovered
some useful concepts, like clogging the lanes and knight's-move
spacing, but it could end up that Morro is like Othello, where the
strategy is too obscure for it's own good.

Time will tell. If I keep discovering more strategy as I play, this
could end up being good. My intuition fails me presently.

A note on negative feedback:

I mentioned earlier that Morro is like my game Ketchup in that both
feature negative feedback (when you take the lead, a little penalty
comes along with it). For those interested in designing games with
negative feedback, I think a comparison is illustrative. In 2 ways, I
like Morro's negative feedback more than Ketchup's:

1. The feedback mechanism isn't obvious - it's more "baked in" and
less "added on". That may also be a problem, because the rules don't
let on what the game is about, which makes people suspect that it's
plain or stupid before playing. But this is true of all the games I
love - they all hide themselves - so it's a problem I'd rather keep.
The game that inspired me to design games was Hex, and I remember
wondering, after reading the rules, how there could ever be a good
game in there, and then I played it and I went slack-jawed in wonder
at how wrong I was. I want to recreate that in my own games.

2. You don't need a scoring track like in Ketchup to figure out how
many stones to play. You know at a glance.

At this point, I have much more confidence that Ketchup is a good
game. If Morro turns out to be bad, it's negative feedback mechanism
won't be at fault. Rather it'll be the win condition's fault.

Rules of an obvious N-in-a-row game which I guess must have been the
first step towards Morro:

1. To start, White drops a single stone.
2. From then on, starting with Black, players drop two stones per
turn.
3. When you create a row longer than any row created by your opponent
up until that point, you become the leader.
4. The game ends when the board is full, and the leader at that time
wins.

The rules I suggest make for a balanced and drawless game, but still
very tactical, and not much less boring than Connect6, for that
matter. But I guess the main flaw of this is that it's pretty much
decided when one player gets 6 in a row. For the losing player, the
remaining moves must be kind of a sleep-inducing agony. Not great fun.

Was this flaw the motivation for Morro's move protocol?

Exactly right! The game you describe is similar to connect 6, except
the game can go on long after it's decided, and that was my jumping-
off point.

The game you describe does have some advantages though. Among very
high skill players, I've heard that connect6 is drawish, so it would
probably be an improvement for them. They'd have to judge whether a
six was possible for either player, and if not, try to be the first to
5, so that's good. But I'm trying to design a strategic game, and this
game didn't satisfy that criterion.
