I've done about all I can for this game, by which I mean my only play-
tester gave up in disgust, so I figure it's as ready for release as it
will ever be.

As far as I know, Sprouts is the only significant abstract played in
continuous space. It is a good game, I suspect even a great game, but
the strategy is terribly obscure and the tactics even more-so. Yusailo
is my attempt in this under-represented genre, and also a good
illustration of why it is so under-represented.

The most basic rules are the same as Sprouts: you begin with some
number of spots; every move is a line from one spot to another, with a
new spot on that line. No spot may be connected to more than 3 other
spots.

In Yusailo, every spot is owned by one player or the other; call them
X and O if you like. You must start a move at one of your own spots,
but the line can end anywhere, and then the new spot is also one of
your own spots. If your move causes the spot that you *end* on to
become a "dead spot" -- causes it to be connected to 3 other spots --
then you must move again from the new spot. If you cannot finish a
move, then you lose; this means that before you start a move, you must
find a spot that has only 1 or 0 connections for you to end your move
on.

The start position is any number of spots for each player, I usually
use between 5 and 7, but the opportunity for handicap games and ad-hoc
balancing should be obvious: just have a different number of Xs and
Os.

A property of both Yusailo and Sprouts is that every move -- and every
game -- has an infinite number of topologically equivalent
representations. There is a notation for both that condenses all
equivalent drawings into a single position, so it's entirely possible
to re-draw a position if it gets too complicated. In some cases
though, the simplest drawing of a position can be quite complex and
awkward. Because of the chain-move mechanic in Yusailo, what would be
a simple loop in Sprouts can become a tangled nest of links.

My goal was to make a pen-and-paper game that could be learned more
quickly than either Sprouts or Dots and Boxes, and would take less set-
up than Dots and Boxes. I think I have achieved that, but it takes a
particular mind-set to play. It's a game that at the very least
demands good sportsmanship from all parties.

I'm also interested in games like these. I'll try this one when I have
some time.

I know a few other games in this genre but I don't know any with the
ownership of spots. I like that idea.

There's a good book called "Gladstones Games to Go" which has a number
of interesting abstracts, including 2 sprouts-like games:

Sprouts Plus: instead of spots you have plus-signs and you're allowed
to make a connection to each arm of each plus sign (4 connections per
"spot"). Believe it or not this game doesn't go on forever.

Looperman: start with an array of dots, take turns drawing loops whose
perimeter runs through 1 or 2 dots. No loops may cross or touch. last
mover wins (variant: last mover loses).

ahh!!!!! Come on that's not fair. I gave up on google docs in disgust,
not the game. Yusailo seems like a brilliant game so far but I can't
deal with the finicky docs interface for a game like this. Sometimes I
would need to draw a line several times over to make my move.
