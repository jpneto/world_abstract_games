This is an inquiry about a chess variant, which is only barely
a variant, but enough of one to warrant posting here rather than
the chess group.

It involves two matters -

1: that chess openings are too standardized,
2: that white has too big an advantage.

My idea is, that to deal with (1) the players start by arranging
their back rows to suit themselves. This is far from a new idea,
and as usual, it would be proper to insist that bishops start on
both colours, and castling be eliminated as unnecessary.

It so happens, that this can be done so as to partially deal with
(2) as well, which I've not seen suggested before, and seems cool.

The plan would be, fo white to put all his back row on wherever
he likes, (subject to the above), AND THEN black puts all his on.
After both placements, white starts and they play as usual.
(Without castling, as I noted.)

This gives black the opportunity to adjust his own placements
to deal with white's positionings - get his bishops/rooks to
line up with the opponent king, place his own king safely, etc.

Now my query is, what do people think of this counter-advantage
to black? It must obviously be SOME advantage back to black.
Would it be enough to counteract white's 1st-move advantage?
Would it be more than enough, so that black would now be ahead?
If so, what would be a proper reduction - say 4 placements by
white, then 4 by black, then 4 and 4 again. Or what?

I invite any chess players here, (i.e. almost all of you),
to give your opinions on this mater. I would love to hear them!

I asked a friend of mine, Carlos Santos, with a ELO ~2300 about it and
this is his answer:

2: that white has too big an advantage. <i>(Not so big...)</i>

My idea is, that to deal with (1) the players start by arranging
their back rows to suit themselves. This is far from a new idea,
and as usual, it would be proper to insist that bishops start on
both colours, and castling be eliminated as unnecessary.

<i>(Fisher Random Chess uses the same idea. However, Fisher invented a rule 
to allow castling rule. And this is importante if we think about chess nature. Chess is a
better and richer game with the castling rule.)</i>

It so happens, that this can be done so as to partially deal with
(2) as well, which I've not seen suggested before, and seems cool.

to black? It must obviously be SOME advantage back to black.

<i>(My guess is that black will have some advantage. If, i can chose the
placement of my pieces after my opponent, with my knowledge about
standard chess, i guess, after some experiments, i will take advantage
with the choice.)

When i have time, i will experiment.
Best, Carlos</i>

That is a rule Schmittberger described in "New Rules For Classic
Games". Do not worry about re-inventing, for me, it is the most
convincing variant where you can arrange the setup position.

Schmittberger discusses extra-rules such as "no two bishops
on fields on the same color", yet adds that he dropped the
rule, because no sane person did it anyhow. He discusses typical
setup positions then. If memory serves they are with the rooks
in the center, bishops on the corners, and the king next to a
bishop. Since both players strive for a similar setup, it shows
that White's practical advantage persists to a degree.

Ordinary Chess comes with the weakness on f7 (yes, and that
on f2). I think the vulnerable king position in the opening
is one of the sources from which White's better chances stem.
A free setup might mitigate that.

Glad to hear it! I tend to agree.

Good point! Why bother indeed? Most would not make them
the same colour, and why not allow the possibility of two
homo-bishops. (I'm sure there are precedents in the church...)

On the subject of which: I recall hearing long ago, I think
at high school, that there was a top-class game in which
there WERE two such bishops, by promotion. It sounds more
like a puzzle, on 2nd thoughts. A player had to promote
a pawn, couldn't make it a queen or rook (due to stalemate?),
so made it a bishop, then soon after trapped an opponent
rook in the corner with two adjacent supporting bishops, (!)
and went on to win the remaining endgame. Does anyone
else ever recall seeing such a thing?

Speaking of unnecessary rules, I was struck by this comment
of Carlos Santos (relayed by Joao):

> And this is important if we think about chess nature.
> Chess is a better and richer game with the castling rule.

Yes OC, but only because of the king's vulnerable starting
position. There's no intrinsic glamour about castling -
if anything it's a necessary evil. This already makes
me suspicious about Santos' opinions. He probably likes
the stalemate rules too!! c)-: (vomit smiley)

Interesting. There is obviously room for debate,
experimentation and fun. Better for chess!

I would have guessed rooks in the centre, bishops adjacent
in one corner, and king in the other corner next to the queen.
A lot would depend on black or white, and especially on
what white did first, for black.

So not altogether; and...

Very good points. It would be interesting to see some stats
on whether black or white won most, but I expect it hasn't
been played enough for that yet.

Nice to hear from you!

Arimaa uses this exact same rule and the question of whether White or Black (Gold or Silver, in this case) has the advantage has been discussed quite often on the Arimaa forums. The general consensus among the best players, stats in hand, seems to be that this rule makes for a well balanced game with no meaningful advantage for either side.

There's no guarantee that this rule would balance chess to the same extent, but I think it's a great idea anyway.
