I  was struck by Nick's plea about moku-games:

> All n-in-a-row games (that I know of) suffer from
> some mixture of 4 problems:
>
> 1. not enough strategy (tactics dominate)
> 2. draws
> 3. imbalance
> 4. the pylon problem

Joao and I have been playing a game of our own creation
for some time. This seems to be a good time to announce it.

It addresses three of the four problems above.

The one it fails to address is (1) - as tactics still dominate it,
even more so! There is no strategy at all, though conceivably
some artificial alterations to the rules could change that.
However at the moment we love it because of its
quick-fire rapid-change features.

(2) draws - we have never had one, and I cannot see how
one could ever occur without co-operation.

(3) imbalance is corrected by the 12* move modifier, as so often.

(4) the pylon problem, (the presence of "dead clusters" having no
further real effect on the game), *simply no longer exists* !

We call it "SUPER-PENTE", as that is what it most closely resembles,
but another more descriptive name would be good.

RULES ============================================

The idea is simple. It is played on a Go board; (an infinite board in 
theory, but that never goes down well, with the general public!)

The goal is to make 4 (or more) in a row, (orthogonal or diagonal).
The winner is whoever first achieves this.

The move order is, one placement by the first player, which must be
in the centre of the board; subsequently two placements per turn,
*subject to the restriction* that the two stones must not be in
the same ortho-or-diagonal line, whether adjacent or not.

(The key idea:)

If a line of 2 or more adjacent opponent stones become
trapped between an existing stone and a newly-played stone,
they are removed from the board. Stones are otherwise not moved.

======================================= END RULES

I could give some hints or example games, but it will be more fun
for you to find them out for yourselves. The key features of
the game are as mentioned above - surprising twists of advantage
and fate as the game proceeds, very rapid execution of plans,
and the like. Games are usually quite short.

Cool!

But why 4 in a row instead of five?
