How can we use the terms natural/artificial for games, in general?

One way to look at this is to relate naturalness to simplicity. Simple
games like Hex, Tic Tac Toe or, perhaps, Go, seem almost like
discoveries, rather than inventions. But the fact that Hex was only
"discovered" in the 1940s does give us pause to ponder. Simplicity is
culturally dependent, just as are more obvious or trivial things -
e.g. the positional numerical system, or the moral statement "slavery
is wrong" -- which were not so in the past.

Another way to look at this is using History. Games, or game concepts,
that seem to be invented independently are, at least, cognitively
attractive to humans. Perhaps they are cognitively attractive to
conscious beings in general, and so, they may even exist in alien
cultures. Some examples of those are race games, or Tic Tac Toe/Gomoku
variants. Possibly, seed games, Mancalas, also belong here. So, a
natural game would be an instance of one of these archetypal game
concepts. Of course, as usual, the frontier is blurred. Bao is a very
complicated Mancala game. Overly baroque variants can hardly be seen
as natural. Shall we include Checkers/Alquerque or Chess games? And
how many add-ons can a game include and still be considered a natural
one?

A third way to try to make sense of this separation between natural
and artificial, is to look into the game's history.

Games like Chess, Go, Mancala and Checkers have evolved through
centuries, absorbing gaming experience into their progressive
adaptable rules. As in biological natural selection, these games are
more like species, with their life trees, their historical
compromises, their multiple branches (cultural instead of biological).
So, in this case, every game started in one or more human minds, in
some raw artificial state, and was tested in a social environment.
Like most species, most games must have become extinct quite quickly.
But a few were able to adapt to the cultural intricacies of the
memetic landscape of its inventors. And then, when society changed,
games also changed, like any adaptable, flexible population of
organisms. Of course, the analogy only goes so far. Unlike fossils, if
they are rediscovered, games can be brought back and enjoy a new life
eventually under new clothes. (The Game of Ur, and Senet, with their
reconstructed rules, are famous examples).

Just as for the concept of species, we might differ our final
judgement about our recent games. Perhaps Hex will have a biography
(it already has thriving children, like Y). Game inventors,
nowadays, have an immense set of game ideas and, like alchemists, they
try to mix them, mould them into new games. Most of those, as in the
past, will become extinct and never get beyond being artificial
concepts. Others, because they say something to generations of
players, will be carried along with our evolving society and will
start to have a biography. They will, slowly and in unexpected ways,
become natural concepts.

This is the only one that makes sense to me. In my mind all games are
artificial, because they are made, but if an argument is to be made
that one is more natural than another, one that has formed through
accretions and incremental changes has a better claim than one that
springs fully formed from the head of Christian Freeling.

I find it amusing that what we call "natural simplicity" is anything
but. A Mozart symphony or a section of Mandelbrot has a very pleasing
order to it, one that only appears in artificial things, though it
appeals to us in a very natural feeling way. Only nature is capable of
the kind of complexity we see in weather systems and digestive systems.
