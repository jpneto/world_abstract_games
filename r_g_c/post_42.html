I want to call group's attention to new results in the game of
Goofspiel,
shown by Glen Rhoads recently in the sci.math group. The thread
is titled descriptively "Goofspiel: New results"

Glen uses a heuristic mentioned in a key prior paper:
Sheldon Ross, "Goofspiel - The Game of Pure Strategy"
Unfortunately the Web version of that paper that I found is
pay-per-view so I don't know what that heuristic is! :-(

Interesting read. I don't really understand what is meant by "pure
strategy," that could imply a grand conceptual game like Go, but even
less tactical, or it could imply a game that can be won through a
purely mathematical strategy like the ones he describes. Of course for
human players such an "optimal" mathematical strategy would be sub-
optimal, since it wouldn't be able to exploit sub-optimal play. It
isn't immediately obvious whether one can exploit sub-optimal play
with an adaptive strategy though, so maybe that's what is meant?

It looks very similar to David Sirlin's game Yomi, Glen Rhoads even
describes the same human-generated strategies that Sirlin described.
The rules are quite a lot simpler in Goofspiel than Yomi, and there is
less randomness, but in exchange the value of the cards is so explicit
that I wonder if there's room for unclear valuation, a key part of
what makes Yomi work as a game.

I think that both games raise the important point that hidden
information and randomness are not always detrimental to the strategic
depth of a game.
