Hi,

I'm doing a bit of work on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which is a
new AI approach for move planning in games. The algorithm behaves
differently for games with different characteristics - some games are
well suited to it while some resist it - and I'm interested in finding
the outliers.

Can anyone suggest games of reasonable complexity that exhibit the
following properties:

1. Unusually slow to calculte legal moves for a given position.
2. Unusually slow to apply a move to a given board state.
3. Fast to find Nth legal move (e.g. Gomoku).
4. Slow to find Nth legal move (e.g. Triskelion?).
5. Fast to perform short lookahead (e.g. 2 ply) on a given position
(e.g. Gomoku again).
6. Slow to perform short lookahead on a given position.
7. Unusually low branching factor.
8. Unusually high branching factor.
9. Long move sequences for either player (e.g. Chinese Checkers).
10. Delayed reward, i.e. positional strength not clear until the end
of the game (e.g. Omega, maybe Othello?).
11. Immediate reward, i.e. immediate positional evaluation is a good
indication of who will win.
12. Random playouts give good estimate of who will win.
13. Random playouts give poor estimate of who will win.
14. Games in which a win or loss is never far away, i.e. high ratio of
leaf nodes in the search tree (Palago?).
15. Games in which a win or loss is very remote at the beginning but
gets closer as the game progresses (Hex?).

Basically any game that will affect the performance of MCTS/UCT by its
very nature.

There are several games that come to mind. Connect6 has
a high branching factor by common standards, but it also
has many leaf nodes. Since most fields with a certain
distance to the action do not matter, the search tree
can be trimmed easily by algorithms that go beyond MCTS.
On the other hand, it might also be possible to play in
a way that spreads out, thereby negating the effect
somewhat.

Pilare by Jorge Arrausi shows branching factors well
beyond those of Connect6 once players start to grow
stacks. Tall stacks mark the criss of the game, however,
and they usually indicate that the the end is close.

Unlur by the same author has a contract stage. I wish
good luck to everyone who is going to program that using
MCTS. He will need it.

Symple by Christian Freeling has a kind of contract
stage, too. After that, ridiculously high branching
factors can and will appear. In real games, 10^12 or
10^15 are possible. Yet, that stage is easy on the
human mind.


In general, I wonder how games with a setup or contract
stage will fare under MCTS. Nine Men's Morris, for instance,
should be tractable.

Thinking about the first two, I guess any game that exhibits them to
any degree will be hard to play for humans also... unless the reason
it's slow to calculate is that there are a lot of moves, obviously.
Games where a move consists of many "sub-moves" in sequence, such as
Arimaa, I think may pose a challenge. Especially if the order of the
sub-moves can matter (as they can in Arimaa) you can easily get a
combinatorial explosion of moves.

It's easy to modify a game to have fiendishly large branching factor.
27x27 hex where players place five stones per move, for instance. I
doubt it will hold much for humans over regular Hex, but it'd be
interesting to know how well a MCTS program handles it.

Lines of action, played on a huge board, with multiple sub-moves per
turn will give you a nice combinatorial explosion.

One game where there is a big branching factor and calculating legal
moves isn't trivial (well, less trivial than Hex anyway) is Punct.
But it's more of a hassle for the programmer than for the program :)

How do you plan to measure the strength of the programs in one game
compared to another? Especially if there are a lack of human players,
can't it get pretty difficult?

Thanks for the input guys.

zickzack: I don't see the problem with Unlur-style contracts. They're
just another move available to the player on certain turns.

I think most programmers would break five submoves per turn into five
subsequent moves by the same player. Perhaps not so good from a
theoretical perspective - it's much better strategically to consider
all moves in a turn as one strategic "lump" - but it works in
practice, as Greg Schmidt can attest (e.g. his Axiom Omega player). So
five-moves-per-turn 27x27 Hex would reduce to a branching factor
similar to Go, at which MCTS excels.

Yes, this gets difficult especially since most of my research will
involve newly invented games that have never been played before and
for which no yardsticks for AI strength exist. But there are ways to
get a ballpark estimate: play the MCTS AI firstly against a random
player and secondly against a flat Monte Carlo player. The results
will give some indication of the relative success of each of the three
AI types.

Luckily the strength of the AI is not the goal here. All I need is an
AI that will put a game through its paces, exercise its rule set and
provide a challenge for human testers. MCTS should be sufficient in
most cases, provided that I can identify degenerate game types that
trouble it.

Hi,

For games with unusually high branching factors several people have
suggested games with multipart moves (Arimaa, Amazons, Omega, Five-
stones-per-move Hex, etc). However, such multipart moves would
typically be programmed by breaking them down into their individual
submoves which reduces the branching factor to something reasonable.

Instead, I'm looking for games in which players must choose one atomic
move out of many choices. For example, a game played on a 19x19 Go
board initially full of pieces in which players take turns moving any
pieces to any other cell (empty or occupied). This game would have a
branching factor starting at 181*180 = 32,580 for the first single
move.

Are there any real examples like this?

Thanks Nestor but those are still multipart moves, i.e. more than one
stone is added/modified by the mover each turn.

What I'm really looking for is a game with an unusually high branching
factor in which the many moves cannot be split into multiple submoves.

Hi Camb,

I was the one that sent the email :-)

The multipart move is not relevant to this discussion. The main idea is
that with an increasing number of neutral stones, the number of possible

I'm confused why your Go variant couldn't be also viewed as a
multipart move, like how you say Arimaa can be broken down into
submoves for AI algorithm purposes.
I.e. first you choose one of your pieces, then you choose another
cell. So you have "reasonable branching factor" again and 2 plies for
a move.
Why would that work for Arimaa but not your Go variant?

Sorry, getting my game designers mixed up.

But none of the moves are actual swaps, they're described in terms of
flips and can be broken down into flip submoves, i.e. submove A = flip
a piece of one colour, submove B = flip a piece of the other colour.

For that matter I guess just about *any* type of move can be broken
down into component submoves, e.g. each Chess move could be described
as submove A = remove a friendly piece, submove B = place it somewhere
else.

Hmmm... must... think...

I guess it all boils down to how a move is defined. Stephen Tavener
suggests that when you get down to it there are only really three
atomic move operations to consider:
1. Add something.
2. Remove something.
3. Modify something.
All moves can be constructed from combinations of these operations.

Any advances on these three?

That sounds like a good approach for the games listed, but I doubt
it works for Pilare. Neither do I see how it would work for Symple
where the decision is to either place a stone or to grow all groups.
The multimove part or the placing part need to be evalued on their
respective merits. Maybe, maybe an advanced UCT player has an answer
to this, but I do not hold my breath to see one.

As for Unlur, the contract phase can be programmed indeed. But a
bad contract spells doom. At least, it will hamper the game of the
computer player. Similar arguments hold for other games with a kind
of contract.

But then, maybe I misunderstood you and playing strength is not
an issue.

Yes, it is easy to design a multi-move game with a high branching
factor. I guess few people would play them for another reason than
a short phase of curiosity. Because of that, I have restricted myself
to games I know to work. These games are usually more than a
multi-move version of another game.

I'm not sure it will work in practice for _all_ games. It depends on
how much individual moves from the same player interact with each
other, change the utility of each other. To clarify: If doing A is
bad, doing B is bad, doing C is bad and doing D is bad, does it follow
that doing A,B,C and then D will usually be bad? The less often it is,
the more I think "lumping" will hurt. I think it will be lot less
often true in 5-moves-per-turn Hex than in, for instance, Arimaa. (I
am not familiar with Omega).

But anyway, this reminded me of something: GF1, the Gipf playing
program, was pretty tough, but if you left a line of four gipf pieces
on the board, it would use a lot of time per move (and probably play
awfully if it searched for a fixed time rather than fixed ply). The
reason being that in gipf, when you form a line of four, you can
choose whether to remove any gipf piece in it or not. Four gipf pieces
just left there would force it to consider every combination of
removals, for every move it looked at, for both players.
That could possibly have been pruned away or handled more gracefully
by GF1 :) But in general, this idea, "remove any or all of these N
pieces" can give a nice combinatorial explosion (probably one that
MCTS handles OK, but nonetheless).

That shouldn't really matter, should it? The question is when
"multiple moves per turn" makes things more complicated and when it
does not. You could even split up the basic chess move in two:

1. Decide which piece should no longer be standing where it stands.
2. Decide where that piece should now stand.

Thinking in this way may even be beneficial: sometimes the primary
benefit from moving a piece is having it in its new position,
sometimes it is not having it where it used to be. But a chess program
that first decided which piece to pick up (just from considering which
piece is least wanted where it is), then where to put it down, would
probably not be very competitive :)

So for at least some games, we can expect that viewing sub-moves as
one will be necessary to play well.

Perhaps the UCT player does not need to be so advanced. If the choice
is between placing a stone and growing a stone then the same process
can be used, it's just that growing a stone means that the next move
remains with the player to grow another stone... then another... etc.

Treating a set of growths as a single compound would obviously be
better strategically, but for games where this becomes combinatorially
infeasible then there is always the fallback position of breaking the
move down into submoves even though this may result in a mixture of
complete (e.g. placement) and partial (e.g. growth) moves at each
branching point.

So there will be an optimal time to select the contract just as there
will be an optimal cell to place a piece each turn. I think the same
process can be applied to both.

Playing strength is an issue but not the ultimate goal. The AI only
needs to be strong enough to make reasonable moves, not challenge the
world champion.

This is true if each move is considered in isolation, but UCT will
take into account the continuations of each move. The question is
whether the first submove of any given compound move will be visited
enough times that the full sequence of submoves will give a reliable
estimate.

So if submoves A, B, C and D are bad in isolation but their
combination is actually the optimal move this is a worst case that
will trouble UCT initially but it should find the correct result given
enough time.

Can you suggest any game in which this occurs naturally?

I think that is a feature of many multi-move games. In Sygo,
another game from the Symple family, A, B, C, and D can be
moves that cut off a group from connecting to other ones. When
all four moves are needed to kill that group, it fits the
description above.

There is another feature of multi-move games that comes into
play here. Assume n is the number of submoves per turn with n
fixed. Assume further that you have a winning threat for which
you need m submoves. If your opponent manages to play threats
which you have to answer with o > n - m submoves, then you will
not be able to execute that threat. The pattern can be mutual,
turning into a kind of Ko fight. Craige Schensted calls it
Limbo: http://ea.ea.home.mindspring.com/*DoubleStar.html.
Combine that with the pattern above and it gets really hard
for MCTS, I guess. UCT should do better.

For MCTS, how you break down the moves can have drastic effects on the probabilities. For example, if you divide pawn promotion in chess into (1) promotion to queen, and (2) under-promotion, and then further break down (2) into rook, bishop and knight, the results will be quite different from giving all four choices equal probability. So how you present the choices does matter. On the other hand, a human or computer, trying to optimize, could adjust the search depth for different kinds of choices, so how you break it down isn't so crucial.

Hi Larry,

One of the beauties of MCTS is that its search is asymmetric and
automatically adapts to fit the search space; more promising lines of
play are investigated more deeply than less promising lines of play.
So this might address the point you mention.

Hi Cameron,

Sorry, I spoke out of ignorance. I'll have to look at the algorithm when I get a chance.
