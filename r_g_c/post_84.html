Hi All,

I'm interested in knowing how long the ko rule has been used in Go.
This includes any form of ko or superko in any form of the game.

So far I've not been able to find any documented evidence prior to
1920, though some players seem to think that ko/superko has been used
for centuries if not thousands of years.

Can anyone shed any light on this, or point me to the relevant person
or literature?

Thanks,
Cameron

There is Tibetan Go which is supposed to be an archaic
form of Go. In Tibetan Go, you may not recapture on a
field where one of your stones has been captured in the
last turn. The difference to the modern Ko rule is that
it applies to the capture of more than one stone, too -
no "eternity" in the sense of the modern Ko rule.

I cannot remember any source stating when the transition
took place.
