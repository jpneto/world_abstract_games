Joao and I have recently been considering the possibility
of playing such games as Backgammon, Einstein, and so forth,
that need dice rolls to effect the moves.

Can anyone think of a method?

Possibilities might include...

1) using trapdoor codes in some way;
2) letting each player have a "hand" or "bank" of numbers;
    that must be used up before being replenished;
3) having the opponent have some input into the roll, in some way;
4) using a public random number like the last digits in the daily
    published temperature;
5) something else?

2 & 3 probably go too far away from the true effect of dice rolling,
but might be of interest in their own right.

4 would probably only work for people in the same area,
and for players willing to post every day.

1 seems fine if the details could be worked out.

Can anyone help out with 5?

How about using a function of the digits in the time stamp on the
email to the current mover's mail client? These should map easily to
dice values and be indisputable.

Using the hour and minute values would be insufficient as some
"special" people would no doubt delay sending their emails until an
exact time to give beneficial dice rolls, but the second values should
be pretty random.

So what mapping would work? Maybe something like:

d1 = secs / 10 + 1; // range 1..6
d2 = (secs / 10 + secs % 10) % 6 + 1; // range 1..6

so your message received at "Date: 10 March 2011 16:59:23 CET" would
yield d1 = 2+1 = 3 and d2 = (2 + 3) % 6 + 1 = 6, i.e. the dice roll
{3, 6}.

The d1 values should have a random distribution but the d2 values will
have some bias, there may be better mappings.

You could always use a dice server to get impartial rolls:

If you use the same random seeder (number of seconds) for both dice
then the dice values won't be independent of each other. In fact you
will randomly get one of the 10 possible pairs while you should have
36 pairs.

Eh? No there should be all 36 combinations. You might have
misunderstood the functions I suggested.

Sorry, of course there will be more than 10 possible pairs :) Don't
know what I was thinking about (may be about the last digit in
"secs").

But, still, in your functions d1 & d2 are not independent since they
use the same seeder that doesn't map uniformly to 36 possible pairs.
For example for d1=1 you have two "chances" to get d2=2 (sec=1 and
sec=7) but only one chance to get d2=1 (sec = 6).

There are standard cryptographic ways of doing this, I remember
reading about them in my old copy of "Applied Cryptography", though I
can't remember the details :)

A quick and dirty way of doing it: I choose a secret password, and
generate a large list of random numbers in the range 1-6. I append
these and send them through a cryptographic hash (one-way) function. I
send you the hash, and ask you to choose the initial index ("split the
deck"). Thereafter, each time you need to throw a die, I take the next
number in my list starting from that index.

Once the game is over, I send you my list and password. You can then
run them through the hash function to verify that they were the ones
used, and you can use any statistical test you care for to check that
the numbers are indeed generated randomly.

This only works when I have no interest in knowing what numbers you
will roll beforehand; It works if I'm the croupier at a virtual casino
(indeed, I'm suprised anyone spends money on a virtual casino without
a guarantee of this sort!), but if we're playing backgammon against
each other we need a slightly more sophisticated system: Then we need
to both keep such lists, and combine the number on my list with the
number on your list each time we need a fair die roll.

Auditing the logs would be a bore, though ;) better to just handle
this like they do at Rognlie's PBEM server: just trust s third party
to roll fairly.
