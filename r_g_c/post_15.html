My submission is now named Kitaran. The most recent rules will always
be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110214094823/https://xifeng.posterous.com/new-as-yet--game">http://xifeng.posterous.com/new-as-yet--game</a>

This is only my second game to make it this far in the development
cycle (I've played it a few times and had a lot of fun). As such, I'm
new to a lot of the emotions that surround making a game. It's almost
like something alive: I may have invented the rules, but I had very
little idea what kind of game those rules would create. So I have a
kind of irrational love for it.

On a turn, you may place a stone of your color on an empty space, or
you may flip all the enemy stones adjacent to one of your stones
already on the board. You may not flip a stone that was flipped on
your opponent's most recent turn, or one that was placed on that turn.
If you cannot flip all of the stones surrounding a piece, you may not
use that piece to flip any stones. But any stone may be the center of
a conversion. When the board is full, the game ends immediately. The
player with the most stones wins. You may not pass. If one player is
determined to have an advantage, players may agree on a komi before
they begin.

I've taken a slightly different route from most designers I've
followed. I was not interested in making a mathematically elegant
game; I am not concerned that it is not theoretically finite. I have
tried to instill my own values in this game, but like a child, it has
its own nature that may turn out quite different from what I expected.
So far it is going in the directions I hoped: the yin-yang cycle is
reflected in both old-young and firm-yielding forms at different
levels of abstraction, it feels very clear, and there's a distinct
feel of motion. Even should it become degenerate in the future,
learning it and playing it will be a rewarding experience until then.

Best luck to everyone,
Tristan

I get an "irrational love" for many of the new designs I try out. It
slows me down because I have to play it a bunch and then sit around
for a week until I can evaluate it without the haze of irrational love
clouding my judgement. I wish it would go away!

Also, I see you're using posterous! I love posterous. Glad to see
others using it.

In the meantime, one unanticipated negative for me in electing to run
this design contest is that I probably shouldn't comment on the
submissions (although I already did comment on one before realizing
that I shouldn't). Sad face.
