I've posted a new game over at my blog: http://nickbentley.posterous.com/33653960

You may want to go to the blog to read the rules, because there are
illustrated examples there which will clarify them (I'm not sure words
alone do the trick). Nonetheless I describe the rules below as well.

The game is a cousin of Othello (also known as Reversi), so I may
submit to the abstract game design contest. Or not, depending on if I
design anything better before the deadline.

Note: I haven't played it enough to know that it's bug free, and as I
play it I may find ways to refine and improve it, so the rules may
change.

The game emerged from issues I have with Othello, chiefly:

* It's too tactical, and not strategic enough.
* Players have limited options as to how to place their stones.

Arrello is an attempt to avoid these problems.

The name is a combination of the words "Arrow" and "Othello". I chose
this name because the relationship between the stone you place and the
stones you flip is similar to the relationship between an Amazon and
an Arrow in the classic abstract game Amazons.

As always, feedback, especially constructive criticism, is welcome.

Arrello is a 2-player game played with two-sided stones (green on one
side, red on the other), on a square grid with an odd number of
cells. I recommend a 9x9 grid.

Rules
1. Players take turns. One player plays stones red-side up, the other
plays stones green-side up.
2. On your turn, you must place a stone of your color onto any empty
space. If you place it (diagonally or orthogonally) adjacent to a
same-color color stone, you may optionally flip opponent stone(s).
Here are the rules for flipping:

*You may flip any opponent stone or row of opponent stones which are
in an unobstructed straight-line path (diagonal or orthogonal) from
the stone that you just placed. See examples below for clarity.
*If your opponent placed a stone non-adjacent to any same-color stones
on his most recent turn, you may not flip it on your current turn
(though you may flip it on later turns)

3. The game ends when the board is full; the player with the majority
of stones on the board wins.
