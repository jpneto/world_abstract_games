Hi and hello,

I recently joined this group and Nick's contest just inspired me. I
looked for my old Reversi board and played around a bit. Well, I don't
know if this exists already, it seems too straightforward -- anyway
here is my entry to the contest:

Nice concept! I look forward to trying it out.
Where does the name come from?
...and while I'm asking I've been curious about Volo's name as well.
I imagine 'Vogel' but I'm sure.

Thanks,
Daniel

Thank you, Daniel,

and, oh it's all Latin. My kids are both struggling with Latin at
school and Papa is here to help :/
So ... volare = to fly, volo = I fly
vertere = to turn over, verto = I turn.

"Vogel" seems to be an old German word.

I'll be in NÃ¼rnberg too, and we should find some more time there
(Essen's too noisy). Looking forward to meet you! I'll take a Volo
board with me.

I know this may be difficult to understand, but this is almost the same
as an entry I am preparing. I will endeavour to finish mine off today.
But I think it is a strange coincidence. There are differences, and I
will play on those. The capture mechanism, as I describe it, is a
variation of the cannon in Xiang Qi, and my games is called "Mortars"
and is described as being part of a family of games I call "Mortars and
Screens". I briefly describe other games in the family, though some of
them are more involved.

I will send this entry as soon as I can as well as reply to earlier
messages shortly afterwards: at the moment, other committments have
meant getting the time to do this has been limited for me.

Hi Dawei,

I understand this absolutely. As I said, I had an intuition that it
may already exist somewhere.
Now I'm curious about Mortars!

Memes! There are game memes in the air :)

The number of times a game idea occurs to different people around the
same time is remarkable, and I suspect happens a lot more than is
realised.

The latest meme wave seems to be games with goals related to group
size. I can only recall a handful of previous group-size games, but
this year new ones seemed to suddenly pop up all over the place.

I've added a small additional rule to Verto (http://spielstein.com/
games/verto).

-- Stones may only entered on corner spaces if there is another stone
adjacent.
(It follows from the other rules that this other stone must be an
enemy stone.)

Like in Reversi corners are special, but Verto needed some more work
on this. Anyway, I think this exception rule does not lower the
elegance factor of Verto (how high it may be :)

I think it would be more elegant to make corners behave as edges, i.e.
a stone there can be flipped by two enemy stones played on the
adjacent squares.

Nice idea, luigi!
Anyway, I'm not so sure that this is more elegant. I'll stick to my
solution as it is derived from the other constraint rules already in
the game and it doesn't introduce a new capture pattern.

Hi,
I've created an AI program for Verto. You can download it at

http://spielstein.com/games/verto/verto.jar

Version 0.1, very basic, for now only human (you) vs. the algorithm;
programmed with Java and with much help and input I found at
http://www.mcts-hub.net. -- Thank you, Cameron!

Command line options:
java -jar verto.jar <STRENGTH> <SHOW_LEGAL_MOVES>

<STRENGTH> = 1..n: strength of the UTC algorithm
<SHOW_LEGAL_MOVES> = true or false: display all legal moves

Comments are welcome.
Have fun!

In fact, I'm wondering if a special rule for corner squares is
necessary at all... After all, it can't be really that advantageous to
place a piece there, since you won't be able to join more pieces to it
until some enemy pieces are around.

My plan was to avoid too obvious/defensive play: As you are safe in
the corners, the first 4 moves of the players could be placing stones
there. And I didn't want to end up with a Reversi setup (here: the
corners preset).

You won't gain territory on the board joining your stones, but rather
by capture moves. So it can be advantageous to leave a stone in the
corner safely waiting alone for the opponent to approach.

Thanks, Luigi for your thoughts about the game, they are much
appreciated.
