Quick, self-aggrandizing note: Ketchup is a finalist in Daniel Solis'
1000-Year Game Design Challenge, along with 6 other games, all of
which look like they could be better than Ketchup.

So winning is probably still a long shot but who cares I'm awesome.

Woah, I did not expect Neighbors to make the cut, at all. I'm pretty
sure Ketchup is the better game, and it definitely has a stronger
community support, so I wish you luck.

Thanks. I haven't played Neighbors so I can't compare. Pretty sweet
that 2 of the 7 finalists are R.G.C. denizens. Represent!
