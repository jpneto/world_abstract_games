I am hoping that I can get some feedback on a new design of mine.
Itâ€™s a perfect information area majority game with a set number of
rounds. 10 for each player so it plays quickly yet I hope it still has
significant depth. One thing in particular I am concerned with is the
endgame. I havenâ€™t played it enough to get a base of data but it
appears that I might need to make some adjustment for the last players
turn since having that last play is potential very powerful.

Here are the rules, board, and pieces http://www.pyromythgames.com/Planet%20Z.pdf
If mounted on cardboard it works well although you might want to use
your own cubes, etc.. for the claim markers if you have some.

Thanks in advance for your input.
