As people may know, I usually like to thoroughly
play-test a game before releasing it into the wild.

However, as Nick Bentley has inaugurated a policy
of throwing out half-considered ideas, in order to
jeep up discussion and cross-fertilization on them,
I thought I'd try the same.

I am also inspired by Nick's excellent theme of
approximating negative feedback by having a game
where one wins by finishing up with the largest
connected group, while at the same time having
rule-sets that otherwise encourage keeping groups
as small as possible. Such games typically are
fun to play, as Joao and I have found.

So here is my idea:

1: Hex-hex board (IMHO best for largest=group-wins)

2: One stone played per turn in an empty cell.
(Standard variations:- 12* modifier (for speed emails),
Maybe use "Sabotage" modifier - i.e. may play opponent stones)

3. (The key new rule) Instead of a placement, one may do:
If two of one's own stones have an uninterrupted queen-move
view of an opponent stone, they may kill it (by joint co-ordination,
military style), AND all the group it is part of !!

That very last point is what keeps the groups small for
as long as poss. It is OC directly borrowed from Nick's
last game idea. The idea of killing by co-ordination is part
of Abbot's "Ultima" game, though not elsewhere AFAIK.

Perhaps the game could be called "Triangulation".

If anyone has any comments, or suggestions
to make that might improve the game, please write in.
Any of the above 3 points (or any others) are fair game!

It seems prone to cycles on the face of it. Maybe you could have a rule that a player must place a permanent stone on the "triangulated" point after a capture. Whether that permanent stone should be friendly, neutral or enemy should be determined by playtesting.

I agree with cycles comment. As soon as you introduce captures, a straight largest group win condition is probably not enough, because as the board fills captures get more likely so the board never gets fully full. The general concept is quite nice though, and reading about it is just the kind of response I was hoping for in reply to my half-baked ideas!

I like the Luis' idea to replaced the "triangulated" point with a permanent stone.

Nick, this could be the solution for your game too (I'm referring to our talk on bgg), making your game with one unitary winning condition.

I would suggest an extra rule: the board starts empty and stones may
be dropped onto empty hexs. This way there's no big groups at the
beginning.

There should also be some advantage of having groups. Perhaps
the winner is the one with the largest group after something happen?
(egs, captures % stones, reach the opposite edge)

There is (at least) one game, Kefren, that uses the triangulate concept

http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/kefren.htm

but does not include group captures.

There's another that I know, called "Life, the Universe and Everything" :-)

I agree that it's a good idea and I'll explore it, with the caveat that I will try not to make my game too much like Bill's. For example, I'll keep my capture mechanism and leave triangulation for Bill's game. 

On a side note: I did the first playtest of heatseekers last night, with six bowls, and it went surprisingly well. I'll definitely going to work on it, as I smell more blood than usual. A bunch of surprising tactics popped up immediately. Always a good sign. 

ps I'm glad to see a little activity in this forum. It's tiring dealing with you know who in the other forum

Yes, Corey Clark's Rampart, especially the Hex version. My first impressions could not have been better - if that impression holds with more play it could be a classic:

Agreed this will probably lead to cycles.

So perhaps the rule should be: rather than killing
the group of the triangulated stone, it is reversed
as in Reversi. Of course, a player may construct
a group covering more than half the board - but that
doesn't mean he has an automatic win then - it could be re-flipped!

Thus an element of "opposition" enters - the last to flip
the huge group wins the game!

Hi,

disregarding the group winning condition and the placement only style, I used "triangulated" pieces already in Attangle.

http://attangle.com/rules/official

Here the two attacking pieces are moved, i.e. one of them is placed on top of the attacked piece and the other one (the "supporter piece") is taken back to the stock. This way the attacker, gaining a stronger position through the capture, is also weakened at the same time because he loses a piece already placed on the board. It's another game but regarding the capture mechanism we met here. Maybe it's helpful bringing your idea forward.

There's a  called Full Metal Planet which also uses triangulated capture, I believe: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20/full-metal-planete

I remember that I started with the generalized form where n pieces (from all visible paths) capture one; kind of star capture :)

In Full Metal Planet, you do need 2 units both attacking a defender,
but it is not "triangulated" capture as i understand that to be
described earlier in this thread, in which one of the attackers is
moved to occupy the defender's space and the other attacker is removed
from play. Rather, in FMP the 2 attackers remain in their positions
after shooting at and destroying the defender.
