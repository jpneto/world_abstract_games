Corners and Ugliness, again. (2)
===============================

So now about the controversial term, "ugly", in games.

It is a totally subjective matter of course, in games as in math.

And there is no disputing matters of taste!

This being so, it is a great pity that people might
crash and burn over the use of this term. But the fact is,
game designers AND game players frequently describe a game,
or some particular feature of a game, as being "ugly".
It is so common, that there might be some intersubjective
feature to it, as much as there is in painting, for example,
(which is almost none at all, these days!)

So what could it mean? There is a nice list of game features
that goes around, listing "drama" and various other features
of games, that may contribute toward a game's excellence.
I don't recall that "purity" or "simplicity" was one of its
categories, but perhaps it should be? For example, almost
anyone who has played Go for some time, and also many complete
beginners, are tremendously impressed that a game of such
drama and profundity can emerge from such an incredibly basic
set of equipment, and almost as simple a set of rules.

This is so common, again, that I feel many folk regard
*simplicity* as one of the contributing features of excellence
in games. Almost all those of a mathematical bent, I guess,
but many others as well.

There are many the other way too, OC, many who love a bit
of ornamnental complexity for its own sake. This is VERY
common in commercial themed games, OC, but also in many
commercial abstract ones as well. It is less common,
but still seen in some abstract public-domain games as well.

A classic case, OC, THE classic case, is chess.
Chess, in various geographical variants, is tremendously
popular all around the world. Not a designer game, OC,
but a historical one, and one whose mixture of complexity
and depth is a major contributing feature of its popularity.

Still, suppose we had a world without chess, but still with
all other board, card, and other games. Perhaps Checkers; or
maybe Go, might hold pride of place in games in the West as well
as in the East. Now suppose in such a world, some game designer
came up with the rules of modern chess - including 2-step pawns,
en passant, castling and its prohibitions, variable promotion,
stalemate - the full catastrophe! Such a game and its
inventor would almost be laughed out of court! The complaints
about the large number of piece types, the ad hoc rulings,
the whole sorry mess, would make it and him an object of
ridicule for quite some time.

OC it may well still happen that it would attract a sect of
faithful devotees, who would slowly increase, spread the word,
write strategy books, set up clubs and tournaments, and have
it finally achieve a place in the world that it enjoys today.

But that seems fantasticaly unlikely. Most likely it would fade
away quickly, leaving few ripples in the abstract game world.
And this would be due to its seen-to-be unnecessary complexity.
It would probably be seen as a crazy rip-off of commercial
ideas with neither the simplicity of most designer games,
nor the realism of true battle-simulation games.

Essentially, complexity for its own sake, is a poor thing.

Thus I feel that if the essential idea of a new game can be
instantiated with as few extra complications as possible,
then that is a good thing. And I suspect that a large part,
perhaps the larger part, of the abstract game world would agree.

Unnecessary complexity is one of those things that contributes,
however slightly, towards "ugliness", whatever that may be.

I think that if a game maintains clarity, any amount of complexity is
acceptable. Chess of course, and its kin from around the world (Shogi
makes Chess look elegant) but also Arimaa and maybe others I can't
think of right now. Meanwhile most combinatorial games are very simple
and elegant, but utterly lack clarity.

Stretching a bit, there are quite a few non-abstract strategy games
with a great deal of complexity, that still maintain quite a lot of
clarity. I'd get laughed right out of here if I said which, but there
are some very complex games out there with incredible clarity and
sufficient depth to maintain a robust community for more than a
decade.

If the complexities are easy to grasp on an intuitive level, then they
don't appear as complexities from a strategic point of view. This is
true of Hex's shared corners and Havannah's special corners both. It's
true of Arimaa's pushing rule, and also Taasen's completely different
pushing rule.

My own belief is that the strategic properties of a game are
infinitely more important than the mathematical properties. One might
read the rule-sheet for a few minutes, and admire the elegance, but
such pleasures are fleeting next to the endless discoveries waiting in
the strategic realm. One does not spend a lifetime studying the rules
of Go, but the strategies. The two are intimately connected: good
rules and good games often go hand in hand. But it's correlation,
there are many counterexamples to rule out causation.

I think this is an idea peculiar to abstract game feinschmeckers like
ourselves. As you said, complexity with aestethic as opposed to
gameplay purpose, as well as "inelegant" complexity for subtle
gameplay purposes, doesn't seem to bother most players. It's not just
chess. Look at all the rulings about triple ko and similar in Japanese
Go rules.

People who go ahead and publish an abstract game without seeking
permission/education from our clique first (and they are still the
majority!) also don't appear seriously bothered by exceptions for
gameplay or "theme". Kamisado, for instance, isn't exactly free of
them.

Although _this_ community is prone to laugh at such highly
idiosyncratic games, that doesn't mean the world laughs at them.

I think I can I understand the motivation for designers who add lots
of nooks and crannies to their games. They set their own stamp on it,
they can truly call it their own. Truly fundamental games, however,
like Hex, don't really belong to their inventors, much like physics
doesn't belong to Newton.

Some designers seem to want to be the Newtons (or Einsteins) of
abstract games. Some would rather be the Michelangelo, or maybe the
Bach. Others seem more like Andy Warhol. I won't laugh at any of them,
and I don't see it as my job to judge any particular approach as less
worthy - though I do have my own tastes in games.

I wouldn't call Go mathematically elegant due to the superko rule. Go
might be a great game and its patterns might be of mathematical
interest but a game that uses the Ko rule in such a fundamental way
isn't what I would call "mathematically elegant". Oust is
mathematically elegant. It makes clever use of the dots and boxes
metarule, you must end your turn with a move that does not improve
your position immediately. This allows the tempo to shift in a game
with a capture mechanism that on its own would make for a trivial and
dull experience. It doesn't simply say "don't do that", it is encoded
in the board-state (smaller groups cannot capture larger ones). That
is my idea of mathematical elegance. To call a game which relies on
the player's faculties of memorization mathematically elegant seems
like an oversight to me. Not trying to get on anybody's nerves, I'm an
advocate of Go. It's infinitely more worthy of praise than Chess and
by the standards of an ancient game it's quite impressive. I just
don't find the rules of Go are very intricate, the superko rule is a
fix-all. I think Hex is the most mathematically elegant game and I
can't understand how any part of that game could be considered "ugly",
least of all the corners. I can only think of one slightly ugly rule
in modern Hex and that's the pie rule.

The usual critique of Chess has been issued. And as so often,
it fits almost any game from the Chaturanga family, easily the
most played family by one or two orders of magnitude. It
indicates that something is being overlooked here.

But let me first switch from Chess to Shogi. Shogi is like
Chess, just more complicated, and an excellent game to boot.
There are people who argue it is the best boardgame of all.
It is a game that has grown naturally. While some of the rules
such as the particularly contrived tie-breaker rule - a rule
that is hardly needed because Shogi rarely ends in a draw in
the first place - is the palpable consequence of purposeful
design, the game has evolved over the centuries. Rules and
pieces were added, adapted, or dropped because it changed
gameplay for the better. Further, as an evolved game, you
know what you get. There are no bugs anymore, only documented
features.

If we contrast that with modern designer games, we see major
differences. Few, if any, designer games have been playtested
seriously. The are full of undocumented features. One of the most
feared features today (this is partly a fashion, too) is that a
game is drawish. For that reason, many designers come up with
games that are draw proof by design.

I do not say they are wrong. Nobody wants to be embarassed,
but there may be wortwhile games with draws, too. Further.
elegance in rules may not be a substitute for superior
gameplay.

Another modern trend is the adaptation of certain meta-rules.
Some in order to balance a game, such as the pie rule. Some in
order to prevent ties, the super-ko rule being one of them.
And if one of these meta-rules does not work, it is quite
likely that the game is abandoned.


First case in point: the pie rule. As far as I know, neither
Piet Hein nor John Nash (who is attributed with re-inventing
Hex) cared to balance the game. That is bad design. It was Alex
Randolph who introduced the pie rule. And since the pie rule
worked in Hex, people transferred it to other games, but they
forgot to check its effect. Have a look at Y. The Y-board
has not got different kinds of corners as the Hex board
has, and it shows more symmetries. That greatly reduces
the number of different unswapped opening moves. Yet, many
designers even try to balance games by the pie rule on the
even more symmetric hexhex grid.

Second case in point, the superko rule. The problem is
aggravated by their being more than one possible superko
rule, one more subtle and refined than the other. While
Go is still a game in search of a ruleset, let us have a
look at Chess. In Chess, threefold repetition gives draws.
Despite complaints about the number of Chess rules, Chess
players get them right, with the exception of this one. The
rule is namely that it must be the same position with the
same player to move in all three cases. And that is often
overlooked. Given that the repetition rules of Shogi, Xianqqi
(both games would be very drawish, if repetition of positions
were a draw), or Go are far more complicated than the Chess
rules, it is likely good for Go that the situations arise
rarely. But then, they still have to be covered by rules.

It is not that a game is bad when it has the superko rule,
but it is a mixed blessing. There is no perfect game and no
perfect design. It is important to keep that in mind when
judging the games of others.

And lastly, many designers come up with scalable games and
overlook that choosing the right board size is part of game
design. Quite a lot of them, possibly with the hidden agenda
of inventing the next Go, go over the top and choose board
sizes that make their games overlong and even more opaque.


In all cases, playtesting would have been a solution. But for
more designers design is a mental process, hardly related to
the playing of actual games. Just as so many design programming
languages without ever writing an interpreter or compiler or
even progrmming in them.

I offer two positive examples: Christian Freeling's recent game
of Symplex has an innovative and elegant balancing mechanism,
fine tuned to fit the game. It is almost as good as the game
itself. In order to find that solution, it helped to play
the game and develop strategies.

The other example is Bill Taylor's Slime Trail. A game so
simple and ingenious that it is hard to imagine school boys
and girls have not played it for ages. And it is tricky.
Yet, at face value, it has a drawing problem. It is easy to
create closed pockets which let the game end without result.

If you do play the game, you see two options to solve that:
1. Pockets allow a finite number of moves only anyway. So,
forget goals or pockets. Last one to move wins. What you
get is basically Dan Troyka's Blue Nile.
2. Forbid to move into a closed pocket. Bang. No draws
possible, and the game shines.


So, my point is that playtesting helps a lot to improve a
game. Even at the cost of formal elegance of the ruleset.
Elegance is a somewhat superficial standard anyway.

Dear Cornerphobes,

I don't see the corners of a Hex/Y board as inelegant; that's just the
way the board is.

Also, I don't see the need to clarify that "corners belong to both
players" as many people do. The aim is to connect the sides, the
corner cells are just conduits through which this may be achieved as
per any other cell.

The only ways that corners might be perceived as inelegant (IMO) are
the strategic: they are wasted space that players do not usually
venture into (the acute corners especially), and the aesthetic: Hex/Y
boards are buggers to stack on a bookshelf :)

Schensted & Titus tried to address the issue of wasted space by
"rounding" their revised Y board so that the corners are "closer" to
the centre, and Antonow succeeded with his clever combination of rules
+ unique tiling for Conhex.

Yes, the whole family is in the same boat.

Possibly. I'm not sure how statistics could ever be collected,
but I would hazard that Go or the Checkers family might win.

Almost every western family introduces checkers to their kids,
but only a (large) minority to chess. Difficult question.

> It indicates that something is being overlooked here.

Oh of course! I tried to indicate that in my post - what is
being overlooked is the centuries, even millenia of enculturation
that long-standing games acquire. Huge libraries of good play,
of history, clubs of devotees in every town, high-prize competitions,
the whole shebang. Once a game has acquired all this, (like chess
in the West and Go in the East), it tends to self-perpetuate,
and gathers momentum regardless of the other more intrinsic
features of the game. Backgammon is similar, (and of even
greater antiquity!), but there are few others beyond Chess and Go.
One game to dominate each ecumene! - the west, the middle-east,
and the far east - Chess, Backgammon and Go.

> But let me first switch from Chess to Shogi. Shogi is like

I'm sure you're right. My problem with Shogi is very specific,
and I am far from alone in it - almost everyone else I've talked to
about Shogi has the same complaint - the physical pieces!

At least one of the fun (though peripheral) things about chess
is the wonderful 3D pieces, both classic and variations.
Just to pick them up is a treat, and they are visually attractive.
But in Shogi (and Xiang Chi) all we have is flat discs with writing
on them! What a bore. And for a westerner, untrained in decoding
characters, they take a long time to learn and are a very distracting
irritation to the main game things. I am baffled as to why
the international Shogi community has never bothered to construct
Shogi pieces, perhaps something akin to chess pieces - though not too
close to them, if the powers are fairly different. These, and their
powers, could be learned in 20 seconds, without cultural dissonance.
No-one is asking the Japanese to use them, but it would be a huge
step toward making the game far better known in the west!

Hear hear! There are far too many - most, even - game designers
who bother to playtest at all, many even do not bother to play ANY
games any more. It is a severe blow to credibility, IMHO,
like a composer who never listened to any other music!

Joao Neto and myself have an ongoing habit of thoroughly playtesting
and altering-as-needed games, by email. I keep suggesting it here,
but no-one seems to want to. And occasionally some games,
which looked good on paper, have to be completely discarded
as boring, unplayable, or whatever. Anyway, they are all
thoroughly tested before being released into the wild!

> I do not say they are wrong ... ...
> but there may be wortwhile games with draws, too.

I agree. Games without draws are fun and dramatic, but games with
draws being at least possible, can be charming too. It can be a great
pleasure to play a tough, hard-fought game against a good opponent,
out to a draw. But the draws must not be too common, IMHO, we don't
want them as an ascape from a bad position, but as a rare result of
hard and equal play. No more than (say) 5% would be my preference.
But the exact amount is a highly subjective taste, of course.
Chess and Checkers are far too riddled with draws.

> So, my point is that playtesting helps a lot to improve a game.

Absolutely-bootly! Couldn't agree more. Please write to me
privately if you want to start up some mutual play-testing of games
by email! Anyone else, feel free to do the same!

I agree completely! As I said in my post, the appearance of
special corners in Hex and Y is merely imaginary, once it is
realised that mere re-formatting removes the special properties
completely. And even makes it prettier! So my earliest remarks
are completely over-ridden by my later ones. Of course,
Havannah corners are another story completely, and, as always,
it's a matter of taste as to whether they are cool or cold.

Very true! They needn't be mentioned in the rules at all,
as I noted, and even sides needn't be mentioned!

LOL!! True. We need special games-shelves that somehow
could accommodate varying shapes. Somebody should research that! ;-)

Another option is to make the board topologically different,
so then a different (but very similar) game, say, "Circular Y".

I'm not so sure about this. I for one never learned draughts as a
child, only chess. Should we take a poll?

They serve a gameplay purpose in Shogi, since they need to be turned
over. Replacing with a piece from outside the board is less practical.

Also, I must say, the Chinese and Japanese characters may be
intimidating, but they're not an obstacle to anything but the most
casual play. I played my first game of Xiangqi without any deliberate
attempts at memorization (it was over the board, not computer). It
didn't cause problems for either me or my opponent. If you asked me to
draw what the elephant looks like, I'd be in trouble. Even identifying
a Xiangqi piece picked at random might be tricky where I'm at now! But
when the pieces are on the board, it's not a problem. The logic of the
game clears up any doubts I might have.

All Xiangqi boards I have seen also have "western"-style images on the
back side of the pieces. I don't think that has made much difference
to the game's popularity in the west.

It is hard to find a game that competes with Chess in the number
of games played. The only competitor seems to be Xiangqi. The
sources I read agree on that Xiangqi is the game of the people
(at least as long people means Han), whereas Go is played by an
elite. With Chess and Xiangqi alone, the Chaturanga family should
take the top place. Yet, the many local variants from Japan to
Ethiopia add to that number.

Other games families I'd expect to see on the top places are Mancala,
n-in-a-row (especially when we lump them together with Morris games),
and Checkers. Go should come after that. But of course, that is
relative. Go is a great game with an old tradition and many players.

I admit there is guesswork involved. And the guesswork points to a
problem: how little scientific work is done when it comes to
boardgames.
Has anyone got an idea how to encourage anthropologists to do serious
work in that field?

Same here. Representation matters on many different levels. For
one, Xiangqi could likely become the game of the people because
sets were cheap. In Europe, however, Chess would not take off
before the Second Industrial Revolution introduced mass produced
Chess sets. Until then, Checkers was the game of the people, and,
in some regions, still is. But then, as Harald pointed out, Shogi
would hardly have been invented with European Chess sets as a
base. With sets like those of Xiangqi, it comes naturally.

Another level on which representation matters can be seen in
Hex. Modern designers know that it pays to think about boards
and grids, and publishers see that some of these games sell.
But up to 1942, a board consisting of an, er, square of hexagons
were practically unheard of. Hence, noone come up with Hex.

As for the rest, the discussion has brought up so many
interesting points, most of which are off topic. They
should come up in the future again. When I delete or
do not answer, it is out of agreement mostly. There is
one exception. You implicitly mentioned an article about
the Three Games (Go, Chess, Backgammon). That article is
one of the worst I know. Not your fault, of course.

I'll reply to messages replying to me tomorrow (it is past midnight
here, and I wasn't intending to write more this evening.) However, I
thought I'd just add an observation amplifying something written about
Xiang Qi, above.

Since myself and my family moved to China from the UK, I have been
slightly surprised at how frequently one sees ordinary people,
road workers, and so on, playing Xiang Qi (often with a small
group of people watching them) on the streets of many Chinese towns at
various times during the day and evening. I have even seen quite a few
cafes which people seem to routinely visit for light refreshment as
well as playing board games (Xiang Qi, Chinese versions of Nine Man's
Morris, Mahjong, and games that look a bit like Stratego as well,
though they aren't that). I have not seen Go (or Wei Qi, as they
call it in China, being played much at all in public.) Now, although the
Han are the most populous of the 57 ethnic groups within China, I have
certainly seen many people I doubt were Han playing it (within my
wife's family, many people play Xiang Qi, and her family are Tujia,
rather than Han). I think it probably is still true that the majority
of Chinese playing Xiang Qi are members of the Han ethnic group, but
that may just because they are the dominant ethnic group, but in-laws
of mine who play it tell me that many more people, certainly not just
Han play it nowadays.

The key thing that struck me, however, is just how often one sees it
played in the streets by ordinary people who, if they were in, say, the
UK, one would hardly see or expect that many similar people would know
how to play chess. Furthermore, the extent to which other ordinary
people are happy to sit and watch people play the games, discussing
the moves between each other and so on, is also much greater. It sounds
elitist, but I do think there is a difference here between the two
cultures. I think partloy it is because Chinese society still values
education and reasoning ability. And to be good at something is a
reason for honest admiration in others, which sometimes contrasts with
the anti-intellectualism I have seen and experienced in the UK.

Of course, sets are available for very small amounts of money, even by
Chinese salary standards, and some of the sets I have seen being used
were obviously hand-made. The Chinese seem to play many different board
games in the open much more frequently than I have seen in the UK, and
all sections of society play them (including a very complicated card
game, a bit like bridge, which I keep on learning a little of, and then
forgetting in between playing it, and which is extremely popular in
Hunan Province.) As far as I know, there may well be many games being
played out there that few of us in the West know about.

The games resembling Stratego are Lu Zhan Jun Qi and variants,
I presume. As for Go not being played in public, can it be that
it comes from Go being played by elites? There used to be times
in Chinese history when it was better not to announce that one
might belong to what was perceived as an elite. That mindset could
live on.

For me, the most intriguing part of your article is the reference
to Chinese Morris games. I'd like to shower you with questions.

Let us hope antropologists can be bothered to write down rules

This is not correct, at least in Western Europe. Several board games from the 19th century had hexagonal tilings (eg, Jeu du Congo; Agon aka Queen's Guards)

I am aware of the fact that there were boards with hexagons.
Since you can build them from coins of the same size, that
is not too surprising. However, building a "square board"
from hexes, as I explicitly mentioned, is quite an unlikely
thing to do.

Maybe you mean something else. Hex does not require a square
board. In theory, it could be played on other layouts, too,
and still be balanced by one or multi-move swap protocols. Is
that what you referred to?

Perhaps the history is unknown, but it seems likely to me that
the pawn and castling rules evolved carefully over decades and
have been tested for centuries! This is different from complexity
for the sake of complexity in a new design.

Speaking of ko: Hasbro has a new version of Connect-4
("Connect-4 Popout") where repetition is not only possible,
but becomes best strategy after a fairly well-played opening.
(Yet Hasbro's rules don't mention the possibility!)

I'm new to this group, and hope to learn here, as I do enjoy
abstract games. Unfortunately, the abstract games that
intrigue me most are the VERY simple, almost trivial ones! :-)

I agree with you, Mr Allen.

BTW, the rules of Bao la Kiswahili might also appear to be overly
complicated, but they too have "evolved carefully" over centuries and
are like a wonderful masterpiece, when "tested" in a game.

The rules of many traditional games are like the grammatics of human
languages, not like artificial and created ones, but more like those
which have been developed as a communal and subconcious effort.

Not carefully, but in fits and starts and reverses and so forth,
like most natural games and languages.

> > ...over decades and have been tested for centuries!

Well, not really. In 1851, when the rules were first fully
finalised for the great international tournmanet involving
Staunton and Andersenn, the previous situation had been that
there were (still!) noticeable variants played throught Europe,
especially involving the stalemate rule, and the tournament organisers
sorted it all out for the first time. Even the FIDE iteself didnt
exist till 1920 or so!

> > This is different from complexity

Oh yes, quite so, which was my whole point, really.

Natural games tend to be "ugly". That is what the population at large
seems to like. They would rather play the somewhat silly-frilled
games like Euchre and 500 than the more streamlined and elegant
(though still defective) Contract bridge. And in Germany, in
particular,
there are some *truly* obnoxious rummy variants called "Dublekopf"
and the like, that are more frills than meat! (Rather like
Western-polluted Mah Jong). By and large the same applies with
board games. It is a pity, but we have to live in the world as is,
and just try to carve out a pleasant corner for ourselves.

Exactly so, and this can be seen as either a strength or a weakness,
depending on one's point of view.

Isn't referring to complexity as 'ornamental' stacking the deck a bit?
I'd say that the complexity in the whole chess family serves the
purpose of making the games play better. What's ornamental about it?
This is no different than the added complexity in go. A 6.5 point komi
fits my definition of an 'ugly' rule very well. But so what? It makes
the game better.

I also don't think that modern abstract game players are as adverse to
complex rules as you make them out to be. While the rules for Arimaa
are not as complex as chess, they're hardly minimalist, and the game
has done remarkably well.

I think that a chief virtue of Mark Thompson's criteria is that for
the most part they examine the actual experience of playing the game,
rather than the superficial qualities like material and rules. Of the
six criteria he gave, it's the four regarding the game-play experience
that are thought of first. The two that treated rules can be removed,
and you only get a stronger aesthetic standard, not a weaker one,
because it encompasses all the games it encompassed before (perfect-
information two-player games) and also games that were previously
excluded, but fit the four major criteria: Bridge, Backgammon, a
really excellent series of theme-games called Fantasy Strike, and many
others.

In my experience, Bridge is quite a lot more popular than Euchre, but
it may be a regional thing. Nevertheless, while I generally find long
perfect-play sequences troubling, I find they each have their own
beauty: Euchre's speed and clarity, like five swift punches; Bridge's
variety and the mind-reading element.

I find your approach short-sighted. Chess is a beautiful game, The Ko
rule has been called ugly and inelegant, yet without it there are no
ko-fights, which are one of the most dramatic (in the literary sense)
parts of Go.

Shakespeare didn't write in Lojban. He used the least-elegant member
of the least-elegant family of languages. Again I insist: results are
what matter.

And in what way does that invalidate that the Chess rules
evolved out of their impact on the game? Do you assume that
only one set of rules could and should have survived?

How do you explain Go then, the game that has the biggest number
of rulesets and among them the ugliest and most baroque ones for
any game?

Doppelkopf is not even distantly related to Rummy by any means, and
the family of card games it comes from is much older. Anyway, in order
to understand the rules of Doppelkopf, you must understand the game.


The Chinese rules of Go have been hailed as elegant. However, they
require you to count every field on an already overlarge board which
is stupid thing to do and a showcase in how not to write rules. The
AGA rules tried to make up for this, but they could not, likely
because
they were designed by comitee, and they left behind a mess. The latter
lack elegance, the former are too elegant for their own sake.

Oh, no, I think you missed my point, which I obviously didn't make
clear enough.

By referring to "ornamental complexity", I meant to imply that
there was also a kind of "intrinsic complexity", which might well
be a very good thing! (It might also not, of course.)

For example, most keen players insist that Go is one of the most
profoundly complex games to play and learn, though its rules
are almost as simple as could be.

Chess has great complexity of play and learning too,
though its rules are clearly substantially more complex,
and even somewhat "ornamental", though most fans tend to regard
this as a "good thing" BECAUSE it leads to complexity of play.

OTOH, Monopoly, for example, has huge complexity of rules and
board set-up, but is fairly simple-minded to play, even play well.
Backgammon is somewhere in between these various extremes,
on both counts.

I'm sure we all agree that complexity of play, *especially*
in regard to the *depth* of emergent phenomena in play,
is a major plus in serious board games. However, ornamental
complexity is no use for its own sake, (though the general
public love it), but only if it contributes to depth of play.

It does in chess, but not in Monopoly, and is unneeded in Go.

"All other things being equal" (as if they ever could be),
ornamental complexity is worthless, even counter-productive,
*except* to the general public, who like bells and whistles
for their own sake.

I hope my viewpoint is somewhat clearer and less repulsive
to you, now?

No, indeed not! They could have gone any of many different ways,

That was my whole original point about chess rules, really.
No doubt there are many ways it could be improved even now,
and lead to even deeper tactics and strategy, but will never happen,
because of the weight of societal momentum.

OTOH, Go is "the way it is" largely because it "has to be" that way -
any significant change would make it an completely different game.

It does indeed, but the oft-quoted Tromp-Taylor rules make

Those things are fairly intrinsic to a game, though more basic,
less of an emergent phenomenon.

Yes, no doubt. The same holds when trying to compare (say)
chess with checkers. It's hard to see how significant data

I'm not sure quite what you mean by this - could you elaborate,
please?

Yes, I agree! It's a game that MUST be played fast.

Though the clarity would be improved by the disappearance
of the "bowers" phenomenon, which is an archetypical example
of a socially-evolved game feature. (Not saying it's
good or bad, just a bit unclear for learners.)

> Bridge's variety and the mind-reading element.

The more-basic Whist also has this to an extent, but bridge
has it in an exquisitely-developed form, never yet equalled,
in spite of occasional attempts. It could still be better
by being simpler, though. The scoring, in particular,
is grotesque!

I too like to play it from time to time, it's great fun to play
and to analyse, though I would never call it beautiful.

It has; wrongly IMHO. If seen in the context
of the general meta-rule of *super-ko* -
no repeat position (applicable to almost any game),
then it might be seen as quite elegant, in fact!

> Again I insist: results are what matter.

I agree; but we might disagree on how these are to be assessed?
Mere popularity might not be so hot.

I agree here. Though I feel it telling in practice that most Chess
variants (not: traditional games from the Chaturanga family) leave
the impression of being pointless.

The core ideas of Go are clear and simple, but they are surprisingly
difficult to put into a complete and practical ruleset.

However, Go has been marketed in the West as having three (or
even two) rules only. Imagine that. For those in the know, the bluff
has been called. In order to somehow live up to this standard, and
since most like mathematical elegance (I in particular am a sucker
for it), axiom, pardon, rulesets have been developed that strive to
have as few rules as possible.

Yet, as the saying goes: as simple as possible, but not any simpler.
Go is a game, not a mathematical exercise, and practicability is
more important than superficial elegance.

The so called Chinese rules have been mentioned. Yes, they look
simple, although it turned out that they beg questions. Three
without capturing, an abundance of ways to interpret super-ko,
or even suicide come to mind.

However, the Chinese rules and their descendants require you to
count every single field on the board, as already mentioned. The
Japanese rules are far more efficient (and less prone to errors)
there. Further, if you play into your own territory in order to
protect it against threats, the Japanese rules subtract a point
for it. If what you did was cowardice, you just have been punished.
The Chinese rules may or may not punish you for that. The same
pattern appears when you place stones in opposing territory.

To put it bluntly: a bug, not a feature. Failure.

At the price of a few extra rules, that failure could have
been turned into success. The AGA rules show how. The Chinese
rules overrate elegance.


When it comes to the AGA rules, I think leaving the choice
between territory and area scoring is ok as long as territory
is the default and both players must agree in order to
override it. Arguably, the AGA rules even deal with "three
without capturing" implicitly. So, superko is the potential
wart that is left. Again, I think the Japanese approach dealing
with triple kos, where neither player yields, as no contest or
even a draw is superior.

And hey, I could do what so many have done and propose a new
ruleset. As if Just Another Ruleset would make it simpler. In
fact, each additional ruleset makes it more complicated. The
situation becomes even worse because some rulesets add extras
like suicide, most likely motivated by the designer wishing to
leave a mark on the history of Go. What a nuisance.

So, I am back to my old observation: how come that Chess is
mentioned when it comes to complicated or even ornamental
rules? Why not Xiang Qi or Shogi? And why not Go, the famous
game from Japan?

And when it comes to games with elegant rules, why do we hear
from Go when there are Y and Connect6? What about Tic Tac Toe?


Go is a great game. But certain myths need not be perpetuated.
As a side note: is it not funny that the Chess world would
happily agree on a single set of rules, while the rulesets for
Go, a game supposed to be more elegant and ancient, proliferate
and all sets miss the mark somehow?

>> Doppelkopf is not even distantly related to Rummy by any means,
> Oh? Don't you have to collect groups of cards?

A trick tacking game from the same family as Sheepshead/Schafskopf
and Skat. Replacing the latter as national card game. Arguably more
rules, but conceptually simpler. 4 players, generally, the players
with the second highest trumps play against the other two. Other
scenarios are possible, like solo games of which only the solo
player knows. One task is to find out who your partners are. Beyond
the scope of this group.

One of my favorites. Kids understand the rules, a telling feature.

As a colorblind person I'd compare them to the use of color in
painting: Rothko notwithstanding, they are generally tools toward a
purpose, and great art has been made with both limited and varied
palates. Or to return to the earlier analogy of language: great poetry
is written in elegant languages like Chinese and Japanese, but also in
clumsy languages like English. Chess, like English, is full of
redundancies and exceptions, and things we wish were not a part of it,
but it is the language that gave us the poetry of Fischer and
Kasparov. I too prefer Issa to Shakespeare, but it would be folly to
project my lack of understanding as being founded on the ugliness of
English poetry.

Only that in playing Euchre I've often known for sure what the best
play was, and that the local bridge column carries out perfect-play
analysis, often all 13 tricks, and even sometimes into the bidding. In
general I'm leery of any game where perfect-play can be determined so
casually. My own Kitaran has been something of a negative example in
this regard, which has taught me to better appreciate such tactical
combos, but also can be chalked up to people insisting upon the
smallest variant, where branching plunges low into the single digits
during the end-game.

About as unclear as the knight's threat-area. I don't think that
bothered me after the first game I played, it's very easy to adjust
to. I found the down-cards a bit more daunting, but even they aren't
too hard to account for, and throw in a bit of excitement when a
missing bower completely upsets a hand, for example.

What other game provides such variety of motion while also offering
such depth of strategy? LoA sacrifices clarity for its variety-of-
motion, but still can't touch the rook-bishop-knight relationship.
Pieces in chess manage to be distinct and of differing values in a way
orthogonal to positional value, but without resorting to declared
values a la Arimaa.

In the experience of playing. Just as music can only be assessed by
listening, and not by reading the score; just as films can only be
assessed by watching, not by sparring with the gaffer. If playing the
game reveals bottomless wonders, who cares how they got there? If we
seek bottomless wonders of our own, we would do well to learn from
whence the came, but when that turns into judging the source of those
wonders rather than the wonders themselves, we have hopelessly cut
ourselves off from the very thing that makes our art wonderful.

> Mere popularity might not be so hot.
> What say you on this point?

"Mere" popularity is the closest we're ever going to get to anything
"intersubjective." I've struggled my whole life with the perceived
imbalance between what I like and what everyone else likes: how much
better my life could be, if only I liked Harry Potter! But I'm not the
sort who can confine anything to the weekend, so I'm attracted to
different aesthetics than just about anyone I know. But I can't deny
the beauty that compels millions of people, among them people I
greatly respect, only acknowledge that it is a sort of beauty I have
little interest in.

Thus, another virtue of Thompson's criteria is that they build upon
the established greatness of the great games, and make predictions
based on that. While they reflect and affirm a certain ambivalence
around Chess and Draughts, they also affirm the virtues of those
games, and importantly they do not contradict empirical findings. One
can discount the opinion of the unwashed masses only at the risk of
becoming an embittered soul who sits in the dark talking to one's
self.
