About the fixed font problem:

"You can also change the font to fixed-width when you view any thread
or individual message. To do so, just click the "More options" link in
the colored bar at the top of the page. Next, click on the "Fixed
text" link. Once you click on this link, all messages will be
displayed in a fixed-width font until you click "Proportional text" to
change them back."

The owner of the group may also (they say) make the entire group a
fixed font group. I strongly advise the owner to do so, so we can
share our pretty ascii boards :-)

About CGT, a game must have the following properties:

a) Two players in alternate single-move turns
b) Perfect Information (no random devices, no hidden info)
c) All branches of the game tree are finite (ie, no matter the move
sequence, even if the game had a pass option, the game always ends).
d) The last player to move wins the game (there's also a misÃ¨re
version, where the last mover loses)

Here is a nice CGT game which no one was able to analyse (so far),
called WInerack:

WINERACK 20
===========
The setup is a row of 20 bottles.

A bottle is available if it doesn't support any other bottle.

A move is picking an available bottle and place it over two adjacent
bottles at the same level. However, a moved bottle must always move to
a higher position.

Last one to move, wins.

Sample position (remember to 'fix' the font)

Winerack is an impartial game (with normal play convention), so it
should be possible to apply the Sprague-Grundy theorem. Anyone here
understand it well enough to do that? :-)

yeap, it's an impartial game but really hard to analyse (eg, a
winerack game does not seem to split into sums of games).

I would recommend that interested people read about impartial games,
imho it's the easiest area in CGT and a good entry point.

This is presumably in Windows, because none of the above seems
to apply on my work computer.

It is running on a Unix background, using Mozilla, and the top line
of the display says things like

File Exit View Go Bookmarks Tools Window Help

Does anyone here have that set-up? How do I get fixed font
on that system?

You can still change it back to proportional text in the options tab
for yourself only, can't you?

I did try to look at winerack with the help of a webpage about CGT,
and I found out pretty quickly that you are right, JoÃ£o. When you move
the first bottle, you split the row in two ... the problem comes when
you split one row, in two, but move the bottle to a third. And when
you combine rows at higher levels.

This is slightly OT for combinatorial games, but I see the seed of a
lovely eurogame mechanism in winerack.

We (=Richard Hoshino, Paul Ottaway and myself) looked at Winerack when
played as a partizan game using red wine and white wine bottles, in
the start position they alternate. Left moves the white wine and Right
the red wine bottles. We haven't been able to answer the basic
question, a puzzle really: given n white wine bottles in a row, how
many moves does Left have? (He wants the maximum number of moves.) We
conjecture that using a greedy algorithm works (moving a bottle the
least number of levels) but that can lead to a situation where a
bottle is lifted to many levels whereas this can be avoided by being
less than greedy at an earlier stage.
