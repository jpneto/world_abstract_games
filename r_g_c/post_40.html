Hi,

playing around with Luis' Verto Zillions implementation (which is very
nice), especially with the variant "Positional Verto" turned on, I
found that compulsory captures are something the game actually doesn't
need. In fact, the positional variant is the better game. I thought
about this variant before, but somehow the Reversi/Checkers scheme of
compulsion forced me into that direction.

Okay, this won't affect the contest, the now old, submitted version is
object of your evaluation. But beyond that, the standard rules will
now go *without* compulsory captures. It is still mandatory to make
all possible captures, but you still won't have to follow the maximum
path.

I'll change the Applet soon.

Have a nice day,

Dieter

I'm glad that my Zillions script has been useful to you to gain more
insights into your game. If I understand correctly, the new standard
variant is Positional Verto with the requirement to capture at least
one stone when possible. If so, that would be a bit trickier to
implement with Zillions, but I'll try anyway.

When playing Verto, I also realized that it was a bit too tactical,
and that there were too many forced sequences right from the
beginning; hence the obvious positional variant included in the
Zillions script. A possible inconvenient I've glimpsed in my limited
experience with Positional Verto is that scores tend to be too tight,
or at least much tighter than in the former standard rules. Not sure
whether that's a bad thing, though.

No, it's still: capture as long as you can. However, you need not take
the maximum capture path. The only change is the removal of compulsory
captures. It's just the positional variant as you implemented it.

Yes, I even would say that original Verto with compulsory capture is
flawed. Normally I do extensive play-testing with computer programs
(not Zillions btw) and face to face games with my play-testing
"staff". For the contest it seems I delivered sloppy work because I
felt pushed.

I've already changed the applet at http://spielstein.com/games/verto/play
(and there will be a mobile (Android) app soon). My experience is, the
scoring is more tight, yet far from resulting 40-41 all the time.

Fine, no changes needed then, other than turning Positional Verto into
the main variant. I'll submit that to the Zillions pages shortly.
