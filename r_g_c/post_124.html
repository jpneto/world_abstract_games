Some game design nerdery for you this morning: 

The Agony and Ecstasy of the Scoring Track

<i>I have an ambivalent relationship with scoring tracks. There are few elements of board game design I simultaneously both like and dislike as much. Because I can‚Äôt afford a therapist for this kind of thing, I‚Äôve decided to work out my issues here on this screen you‚Äôre reading here. Nitty-gritty game design soliloquy coming at you.

Among hobbyist table games, scoring tracks are everywhere. I think there are two reasons for this, one good, one bad, and they account entirely for my mixed feelings.

First the good. The wonderful great supreme thing about scoring tracks is that they make concrete and visually clear the players‚Äô relative standing ‚Äì and so make the race to win feel more ‚Äúreal‚Äù. They boost clarity and tension. The value of scoring tracks are illustrated most clearly, I think, in racing games, like Formula De, which are often comprised of little but fancy scoring tracks.

Empirical testing corroborates this view: in my playtesting, players give higher marks to a game when it includes a scoring track than when scores are tracked by other means (recording numbers on paper, accumulating items worth points, etc).

So it‚Äôs no surprise scoring tracks are in wide use. But this isn‚Äôt the only reason. There‚Äôs another, seedy-underbelly-type reason: scoring tracks are the great enablers of Point Salads (games where you can earn points in a bunch of different conceptually unrelated ways), and Point Salads are often a crutch for ad-hoc, visionless game design. The result is a lot of bland games.

Before you retort, allow me to elaborate on this point:

The personalities of games are strongly defined by the Thing-You-Need-To-Do-In-Order-To-Win. In Chess, it‚Äôs all about attacking the King. In Basketball, it‚Äôs all about getting the ball in the hoop. The goal is the unifying theme around which the universe of a game orbits ‚Äì it dictates all the other rules of the game and thereby creates the game‚Äôs personality. There may be many ways to pursue the goals in Chess and Basketball, but nonetheless there is only one goal in each, and it‚Äôs distinct from that of other games.

Let‚Äôs imagine a world in which basketball was designed differently. Let‚Äôs say you get points not just for putting the ball in the hoop, but also for making at least 7 passes on a single possession, and also for dribbling at least 14 times, and maybe for high-fiving all your other teammates while in possession of the ball, or making one of your opponents‚Äô players fall down. This is the Point Salad version of basketball. Let‚Äôs call it Bunchofdifferentstuffsketball.

How would Bunchofdifferentstuffsketball feel compared to Basketball? Some might like that you have to weigh the value of all these different sources of points against one another, in light of your skill in pursuing each goal. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like this as much as I like basketball, because it would feel like a hodgepodge. It would also have more complicated rules, not only to describe the many goals but also to rule on a whole set of edge cases/loopholes/possible infractions which would result.

If there were many other sports which all took a similar approach, each sport would lose some of the special character that make it its own unique thing.
On the other hand, maybe you could make a silly movie about it.

On the other hand, maybe you could make a silly movie about it.

That, I argue, is how many games with scoring tracks are being designed. When you play, you can do a little bit of this, a little bit of that, but why? What do all the bits have to do with anything? I have no idea. And it feels like 50 other games that take the same approach.

It bears mentioning: many games with scoring tracks don‚Äôt fall victim to Bunchofdifferentstuffitis ‚Äì scoring tracks aren‚Äôt inherently bad, they just seem to encourage bad tendencies in certain game designers. A number games with unified central concepts deploy scoring tracks because those concepts happen to be multifaceted and incremental.

My favorite example of this is Ingenious, which has several different scoring tracks, each representing your progress in pursuing the same goal in each of several different piece-colors. The player who has advanced farthest along the scoring track on which she‚Äôs made the least progress at the end is the winner.
The game Ingenious

The game Ingenious

Ingenious, by the way, is far deeper than most players realize, and it‚Äôs magical: it‚Äôs a deep game casual players can play for fun, blissfully unaware of the hairy strategy which serious study would reveal (the hairiness of which starts with rack management and gets more hirsute from there). In that sense it approaches an important and rarely-achieved ideal for abstract games ‚Äì I wish I‚Äôd invented it.

In an example closer to home, my most popular game, Catchup, has a scoring track, but the game nonetheless has a single goal.

I wish abstract game designers would make more games with scoring tracks. Thanks to their obsession with conceptual unity, such designers are predisposed to using scoring tracks in the right way, and I‚Äôve no doubt there are a bunch of great, undiscovered game concepts requiring scoring tracks. It‚Äôs a little-explored area of abstract game design space (even if it‚Äôs way over-explored in other game genres), so there might be some stupendous ideas which aren‚Äôt hard to find there.</i>

And thus, not actually part of

Is that a correct understanding?

Perspiring minds want to know!

Correct in the same sense that a board and pieces conveniently summarize the state of any other game. Wait since when is representation not an essential part of game design? This is representation on the abstract level, we aren't even talking about implementation here. For a big example, cribbage boards come in all shapes and sizes, but from a functional point of view they are identical. One could represent the same information through numbers on paper or beans in a cup, but part of the total impression that is "cribbage" is a board with pegs in it.

There's an important difference between:

a score board for a game like Catchup or Xodd, which merely summarizes
(redundantly but often conveniently) the current board state "to save
the players having to work out the situation at the start of every
turn",

and:

a score board (or written notes or collected beans or whatever) in a
game like Cribbage, where the current "board state" (e.g. seeing what
cards are currently in play) does not suffice to know the score,
because the score depends on an accumulation of points earned from
past events which are no longer visible, and so the score would be
impossible for the players to work out at the start of every turn.

Obviously the score is a vital and essential part
of the game.  I'm not sure whether you're saying...

(a) a cribbage board is essentially the same as a score kept on paper
or (b) in some way different.

I presume (a).    If so, then the issue of cribbage boards is
beside the point.  (Though as a cultural/traditional matter,
it's nice to fiddle with one, along with all the standard
comments like "15-2 and the rest won't DO".

In a similar way to that last, it's nicer to play Go
with firm clicking stones and a resounding board,
than on screen. 

But the OP was asking - (I presume) - is it good
or bad to have e.g.

1) current score-estimations in a Go game, made by computer;
2) current group-size status in Xodd;
3) current race-status in Backgammon.

The purist in me says NO to all; but the realist in me
says YES to cases like 2 & 3, where the player COULD
work it out himself by a trivial public algorithm, (counting!);
but NO to cases like 1 where some definite higher-level
knowledge is being imported into the play of the game.

What do others think?

I have a similar feeling as Bill. The purist in me doesn't love them, but I get better responses in playtesting when I include them. They have psychological effects that appear to improve players' experiences while playing. (For reference, my playtesters are strategically minded - i.e. they play to win - but they aren't designers or fanatics like most of us here in this forum).
