The subject was supposed to be "draws revisited", but then I
realised that the scope of this article goes beyond that.

Assume we want to compare the strength of players in a
tournament, and let us assume the game played ends in a
win or loss, with equal chances for either player - assuming
they have the same playing strength. Then, the information
(defined as negentropy) provided by a result is one bit.


Compare this to a game where there is more granularity in the
result, such as win, loss, or draw, with the results being equally
likely between players of equal strength. Then, the results of this
game provide more information which can be used to grade
playing strength more quickly (or more exactly).


The case in point is Chess. According to chessgames.com,
the percentages for White wins, draw, and Black wins are
36.81, 36.5, and 26.69 respectively (in 2008). The information
content of such a result is almost 1.6 bit -- 57% more information
from a game than in the previous example.


It should be pointed out that the Chess results do not only
contain more information, they also contain a bias since
White wins more often than Black. Usually, this bias is
circumvented by letting players play a reasonable number
of games with a fair share of White and Black each.


It is possible to increase the information contained in a result
by allowing for even more results. One might expect that
scoring games - think Go or Othello - do this. But interestingly,
the degree of success is rarely taken into account. Maybe the
complex rules for the promotion of professional Go players can
be seen as this. Another. more convincing case is found in
Backgammon where the doubling cube allows for different
values of a game.


I have two questions:


1. Does anyone know an abstract played in tournaments where
the results yield more information than in Chess?
2. Are there other abstracts plaed in tournaments with a wider
range of results?


There was an approach to score Chess games on a scale of 0
to 10. Checkmate was 10 points, draw 5, and other values
being assigned to "baring the king", stalemate, and so on. It
died a merciful death and does not count.

Interesting point!

I have always heard (and believed to be true) that (at least in the
case of go) the margin of victory doesn't really give useful
information, and that's why it's not used.

I.e. if the game involves lots of small fights (or an utterly peaceful
game of each player fencing off half the board) then the resulting
scores will typically be close.

If the game involves a giant all-or-nothing capturing race that
ensures one player or the other will lose a huge group, then the
resulting scores will not be close. But that doesn't mean that the
winner played incredibly better than the loser. It just means the
particular game evolved into an all-or-nothing fight in which a tiny
miscalculation can have much more drastic consequences than in a game
with only small fights.

[Different kinds of play or playing style lead to different scores]

Thank you for the examples! I actually wonder, if the percentages
of results in Chess are an artifact. I mean, if there is a "force"
at work that kind of draws the results to the maximum entropy - as
far as the practical bias allows this. And if that force is mistaken
for Good Chess Strategy.
