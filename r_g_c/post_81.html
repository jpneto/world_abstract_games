New game: AYU
=============

AYU is a misÃ¨re combinatorial game with the look of a connection game.

Definitions
-----------

In this rules, "adjacent" always means "orthogonally adjacent".

A unit is a singleton or group. A singleton is a piece
with no adjacencies to like-colored pieces. A group is a
set of like-colored, adjacent pieces.

Play
----

The game is played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized
square board. 11x11 is suggested as the standard size. At the start of
the game, Black and White pieces are arranged in the following
pattern:

. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .

Black plays first, then turns alternate. On each turn, players must do
one of the following actions:

a) Move a friendly singleton to an adjacent empty point.
b) Take a piece from a friendly group and place it on a different
empty point adjacent to the same group, without splitting it at any
moment.

Every move must reduce the distance between the moved unit and the
closest friendly unit. The distance between two units is the shortest
path of adjacent empty points between them, i.e. the number of
consecutive moves one would need to join them.

If a player can't make a move on his turn, he _wins_. This usually
occurs when said player has joined all his pieces in a single group.
Draws and cycles are not possible.

Here is a sample Ayu game:

(The link will expire in one week, I think.)

As you can see, "misÃ¨re combinatorial" is just a theoretical way of
categorizing the game, and has little to do with the way it truly
unfolds. For all practical purposes, Ayu's behaviour is that of a pure
connection game in the Lines of Action spirit.

As a curiosity, there is a minor, truly combinatorial Ayu variant in
which players must join two or more groups on every turn, and whoever
can't move loses.

I've made a minimal change in this rule to allow for a higher move
freedom. The rule is now as follows:

"b) Take a piece from a friendly group and place it on a different

empty point adjacent to the same group. All stones which were joined
in a single group before the move must remain joined after the move."

This allows groups to be split momentarily during a turn. It's only
relevant in rare occasions, but details are important.
