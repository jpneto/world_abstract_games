In the contest rules, I've specified that designers may, and in fact
should, vote for their own designs during the voting period. I've
received objections from designers who are not comfortable doing so,
however, and I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to prohibit
designers voting for their own games. I'd like to change this rule,
but I'll only do it if there are no objections to it.

So, if you have objections, speak up. Otherwise, I'll change it.

Best,

Oh, please, change it! I was about to start a thread on it before I
saw this one. I have submitted a game to the contest, but I don't have
access to the Internet at home right now, and I won't be able to
playtest the rest of the games, so I won't be an elligible voter.
Allowing to vote one's own game punishes games from designers who
can't be voters.

You're already wise enough, indeed!
