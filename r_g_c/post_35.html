Hi All,

Seeing as that I've seen not terribly much testing activity on iggc
(and frankly, I haven't played all the games yet myself, having failed
to anticipate how little time I'd have to do so over the holidays),
I've decided to extend the judging period for another three weeks. So
you now have until January 24 to send me your votes.

Better get on it, unless you want the contest to turn into Nick-picks-
his-favorite-game-and-calls-it-the-winner (which, if it comes to that,
is fine by me)

Hope everyone had a nice holiday,
Nick
