CORNERLESS Y
============
Corners have always been a slight annoyance in connection games;
they are easily dealt with by overlapping the edges, of course,
but it seems ever so slightly clumsy. Havannah grasps the nettle
firmly and makes them a complete special case. Rather ugly, though.

In Cornerless Y, the matter is solved by the opening layout,
which also has its ugly side, but is quite cute nonetheless.

The board size is flexible, (though can only be of one parity);
the one shown below is much too small for real strategic play.


"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
RULES
-----
The game is Y, with PIE rule, played on a Y board initialised thus:-

           x o
          o . x
         x . . o
        o . . . x
       x . . . . o
      o . . . . . x
     x . . . . . . o
    o . . . . . . . x
   x . . . . . . . . o
  o . . . . . . . . . x
   x o x o x o x o x o
_____________________________________________________________

And that's it! It's somewhat of a marvel that this opening
distribution guarantees a unique winner!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Y-VERSI
=======
The same game, with the same opening layout, but including
Reversi-style captures.

RULES
-----
Board as above. Standard alternating play.

Stones may be played on any vacant cell, and any lines of
adjacent opponent stones pincered between the played stone
and another friendly stone, are captured by colour-reversal.

The game must continue until the board is full.
_____________________________________________________________

That last rule is crucial - a player may well get a Y-group
partway through the game, but does not immediately win,
and may indeed lose at the game end!

Have fun!

I'm going to reveal myself to be an utter moron here, but: it looks to
me that there's no difference between Y with this layout and standard
Y. It looks like a corner stone connects two sides in both cases. Am
I reading the diagram wrong? Or what am I missing?

You seem to argue that because they're a special case, it is ugly (or
worse, rather ugly :) to treat them as such? I'm missing the logic
here.
Now if you were any good at havannah, say 1900+ on avarage at LG, you
would know that the bridge is the soul of havannah.

I'll take it as ignorance, with no offence intended and certainly not
taken ;-)

Christian, I think Bill is overly concerned with the complimentary win/
loss quality and not gameplay. Indeed I don't really see any new
gameplay implications in cornerless Y and it seems rather obvious that
with each cell on the border having adjacencies to both colors that
there will still only be one winner, nothing to marvel at. Havannah
may not have the complimentary win/loss property and it may have races
but it is a far superior GAME. Havannah has its own elegance with each
of the winning conditions being an organic derivation of the others
leading to some very interesting strategic possibilities. The elegance
of Havannah is in its gameplay rather than its aesthetics. And the
gameplay is really what matters- regardless of what us more indulgent
designers might tell ourselves. ;) Bill what you've demonstrated with
Cornerless Y is purely theoretical, as Nick Bentley pointed out and
while it's interesting it cannot be compared to a standout game like
Havannah.

I'm not concerned with that. Anyone may, for lack of inspiration, try
to suck yet another game out of Y.

What I'm concerned with is people not reading what they write, and not
asking themselves what exactly they're saying.

"Corners have always been a slight annoyance in connection games;
they are easily dealt with by overlapping the edges, of course,
but it seems ever so slightly clumsy. Havannah grasps the nettle
firmly and makes them a complete special case."

Corners _are_ a special case, as argued in the first sentence. I don't
know what a _complete_ special case might mean. Is it because havannah
excludes them from the edges? Y includes them in the edges. What's the
difference: a choice must be made.
Other than that, connercells are just as any other cell in Havannah,
so what's the 'complete' (other than that it should be 'completely').

And what about a reply in a forum where 'game related subjects are
discussed in a polite and civil matter'? Till now I don't see much of
that. Please Bill, explain your logic :)

Do I detect a slight conflict here?

Anyway, it's obvious I've stepped on someone's toes,
so I'll politely apologize and withdraw from this topic.

Shifting the focus from the content of a message to the way in which
it is delivered is the oldest trick in the 'Great Book of applied
Mediocrity' and the preferred refuge of the cowardly.
And 'someone' has a name, Bill.
