<p align="left"><font face="Arial">João Pedro Neto (me) and Bill Taylor 
maintained an regular email conversation from c.1996 to 2021 (when Bill passed 
away).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After Bill&#39;s passing, I have made an effort 
to collect and organize all remaining emails from this period in a ~14000 page 
email archive (many earlier emails were lost, unfortunately). This archive 
includes several dozens of games and variants, developed and playtested by us, 
that were never published. I decided to start re-reading the emails, more or 
less in chronological order, to salvage these games from oblivion, and present 
them in a curated catalogue, as a hommage to our friendship, and as a 
contribution to the online community of abstract games.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This page will have links to those games 
already inventoried:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a href="../dagger_gomoku.htm">Dagger 
	Gomoku</a> -- gomoku variant with a dagger that changes hands</font></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a href="../lisbon.htm">Lisbon</a> -- 
	game similar to Havannah, with a new approach to edges, and using of a slow 
	progressive mutator</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a href="../slimetrail.htm#medusa">
	Medusa, Hydra</a> -- slimetrail variant for square and hex boards, with 
	multiple slimes (heads)</font></p></li>
