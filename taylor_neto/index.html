<p align="left"><font face="Arial">João Pedro Neto (me) and Bill Taylor 
maintained an regular email conversation from c.1996 to 2021 (when Bill passed 
away).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After Bill&#39;s passing, I have made an effort 
to collect and organize all remaining emails from this period in a ~14000 page 
email archive (most earlier emails were lost, unfortunately). This archive 
includes many games and variants, developed and playtested by us, 
some already published here at WAG, others still unpublished. I decided to start re-reading the emails, more or 
less in chronological order, to salvage these unpublished games from oblivion, and present 
them in a curated catalogue, as a hommage to our friendship, and as a 
contribution to the online community of abstract games.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I will also not include small variations
