<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some words from the author: <i>Groups is related to
<a href="loa.htm"> Lines of Action</a>, with the differences being that pieces in Groups move only one space, only orthogonal connections count, there are no captures, and the game begins with a drop phase.  The game also bears a resemblance to
<a href="teeko.htm">Teeko</a>, with the movement of pieces to attain a configuration, although in Groups a winning configuration can take any form provided all pieces are orthogonally connected.</i></font>
[...] <font size="3" face="Arial"><i>I had been playing it </i>[the game with no
jump rule]<i> and found that it eventually bogged down with defensive play. I
wanted to speed it up some, so I added a rule that a piece was allowed to jump
over another piece to an empty space. I thought this would open the game up
more. What I had found is that the game grew immensely more dynamic, and much
more offensive, and finished a <u>lot</u> faster. What would go on from 30 turns
for a game usually now finished up in under 10. The play balance seems the same
now, but the game is a lot faster.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There is a ZRF to play <a href="zrfs/Groups.zip">Groups</a>
with <a href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com">Zillions</a> with several other
variants (including one that begins with an empty board, and player drops stones
on the central 4x4 area).
