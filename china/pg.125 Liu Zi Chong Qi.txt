六子冲棋 (Liu Zi Chong Qi)

Liu Zi Chong Qi, also known as Chongqi, Arrow Chess, or Cannon Chess, is a two-player abstract strategy game widely played in Sichuan and Hubei.
Each player has six pieces, hence the name “Six-Piece Chong.”

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 9 cells with 16 intersection points.
Each player has 6 pieces, distinguished by black and white.

Players alternately place their pieces as follows:

4 pieces are placed on the four intersections of the bottom row.

2 pieces are placed on the left and right ends of the row just above the bottom row.

2. Movement

Players take turns moving.
Pieces may move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but only one step at a time.
Jumping over other pieces is not allowed.

3. Capturing

Capturing occurs mainly in three situations, as shown in Figure 2.

(1) Two-against-one (二打一)

When three pieces form a straight line, and two adjacent pieces belong to one player, while the third end point is empty,
if the other end is occupied by an opponent’s piece, that opponent’s piece may be captured.

(2) Two-against-two (二打二)

When four pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging to one player, and both ends occupied by opponent pieces,
the player may capture both opponent pieces.

(3) Cannon Capture (挑吃)

If a player inserts one of their pieces between two opponent pieces, and one end of the line is empty,
the player may capture the two opponent pieces.

After making a capture, the capturing piece may then move one step horizontally or vertically, and may continue capturing using the cannon capture method.

4. Winning the Game

A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces, or by blocking the opponent so that none of their pieces can move.

If both players are reduced to one piece each, and neither can capture the other, the game is a draw.

五道棋 (Wu Dao Qi)

Also called Five-Line Chess.

The board is formed by five vertical and five horizontal straight lines, creating 25 intersection points.
Each player has 5 pieces, as shown in Figure 3, placed on the five intersections closest to their side.

The rules for movement, capturing, and winning are the same as in Liu Zi Chong Qi.
