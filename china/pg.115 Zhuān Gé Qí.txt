砖格棋 (Zhuān Gé Qí)

Zhuan Ge Qi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It is a large square subdivided internally into 32 small rectangles, with a total of 57 intersection points.
Each player has 10 pieces, distinguished by color or shape. Players take turns placing pieces, starting with Black. Placement continues until all pieces have been placed.

2. Moving Pieces

After all pieces are placed, the two players take turns moving.
On each turn, a player may move one piece by one step.

3. Capturing

When one player’s pieces form a target pattern, that player may capture the opponent’s pieces.

The target patterns in Zhuan Ge Qi include:

the “口” (square) shape

the “十” (cross) shape

If a “口” shape is formed, the player may capture any one of the opponent’s pieces.
If a “十” shape is formed, the player may capture any two of the opponent’s pieces — one of which must be the piece that just moved.

4. Winning the Game

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.
