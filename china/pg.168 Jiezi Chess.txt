Jiezi Chess (捉子棋)

Jiezi Chess is a two-player game played using Chinese-chess (Xiangqi) pieces.

Game Procedure

1. Setup
The Jiezi Chess board is shown in the figure. It has a diamond shape and a total of 30 intersections. There are solid lines, dashed lines, and intersections.
Each player has 9 pieces, either red or black. The pieces are:

5 Soldiers (兵 / 卒)

2 Rooks (车)

1 Scholar (士)

1 General (将 / 帅)

All pieces are placed on the two rows of intersections nearest to the player’s own side.

2. Movement
Players alternate turns. Pieces move along the lines, and each move advances one step only.

3. Capturing
Jiezi Chess uses encircling capture.
If two pieces of the same side are on the same straight line or dashed line, and an opponent’s piece lies between them, that opponent piece may be captured.

4. Victory Conditions
The player who captures the opponent’s General (将 / 帅) wins the game.
