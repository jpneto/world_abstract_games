●● 扎枪扯萝卜 (Zhaqiang Che Luobo)

Zhaqiang Che Luobo is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 25 cells, with 36 intersection points.
The two players take turns placing their pieces, starting with Black.

2. Forming “Radishes” and “Spears”

When three pieces form a small right-angled shape occupying three vertices of a small square, this configuration is called a “radish” (萝卜).

If one player places a piece on the fourth vertex of that small square, the piece captures the radish.

After capturing a radish, the capturing player uses their own pieces to occupy the three intersections vacated by the opponent.

When three pieces form a straight line, this is called a “spear” (枪架).

If the opponent has one piece on that straight line, it is considered blocked (扎枪).

In this case, the player may capture an entire row of pieces, and then re-place pieces at the top of the board.

3. Victory Conditions

When all intersection points on the board are filled, the game ends.
The player who has more pieces on the board wins.
