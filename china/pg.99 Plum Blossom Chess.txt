Plum Blossom Chess (梅花棋, Méihuā Qí)

Plum Blossom Chess is a forming-pattern-type confrontational game with gameplay similar to Gather Chess (聚会棋, Jùhuì Qí). Both sides take turns placing pieces, with the goal being to form the target pattern shaped like a plum blossom. The plum blossom patterns are shown in Figure 3 and include the following types:

    Upright Small Plum Blossom (正小梅花) - (Top Left)

    Slanted Small Plum Blossom (斜小梅花) - (Top Right)

    Upright Large Plum Blossom (正大梅花) - (Bottom Left)

    Slanted Large Plum Blossom (斜大梅花) - (Bottom Right)

The game ends when there are no empty positions left on the board. The side with the highest final score wins. Additionally, when placing a plum blossom, one should try to construct the "Double Plum Blossom" (双梅花) shape, as shown in Figure 4, which doubles the score.

The gameplay of Hexagonal Chess is also similar to Gather Chess, but the board is different. The Hexagonal Chess board and target patterns are shown in Figure 5.
