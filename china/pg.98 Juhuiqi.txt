### Game Procedure

1. Setup
The Juhuiqi board is shown in Figure 1.
Each player has 18 pieces of a distinct color or shape.
Players take turns placing one piece at a time. Pieces may be placed on any empty position on the board.

2. Scoring
As shown in Figure 2, when a player’s pieces form a target shape, that player scores points.
Specifically, the score awarded for each target shape is as follows:

| Target Shape      | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Triangle          | 3 points |
| Diamond (rhombus) | 4 points |
| Trapezoid         | 5 points |
| Hexagon           | 6 points |

3. End of the Game / Winning
When there are no empty positions left on the board, the game ends.
The player with the higher total score wins.
If both players have the same score, the game is a draw.
