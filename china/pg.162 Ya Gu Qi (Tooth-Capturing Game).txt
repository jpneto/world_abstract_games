Ya Gu Qi (Tooth-Capturing Game)

Ya Gu Qi is a two-player adversarial game. Its gameplay is similar to Tonggu Qi found in Chinese folk board games.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Ya Gu Qi board is based on a 16-square grid, with diagonal connections added between the squares, for a total of 41 positions. Each player has 9 pieces, which may be distinguished by color or by shape. The pieces are placed on the two rows of points closest to each player’s own side of the board.

2. Movement

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, a player may move only one piece by one step.

3. Capture

If a player’s piece moves to a point adjacent to an opponent’s piece, and the two points are connected by a line, then if three pieces lie in a straight line on the same connection, and the opponent’s piece is in the middle, that middle piece is captured and removed from the board.

4. Victory Conditions

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins. If, after a piece is captured, neither player is able to capture any further opponent pieces, the game is considered a draw.

----------------

Here is a structured analysis of whether Ya Gu Qi is likely to be drawish, based on its rules and board properties.

1. Key structural features that affect draw likelihood
(a) Small, symmetric force

Each player has 9 pieces on a 41-point graph.

Initial positions are symmetric and fairly far apart.

With few pieces relative to space, forced interactions are rare early on, encouraging cautious maneuvering.

➡️ This already biases the game toward long maneuver phases rather than early decisive captures.

(b) Capture requires alignment, not jumping

Captures occur only when three pieces lie in a straight line, with the opponent’s piece in the middle.

There is no jumping capture, no replacement, and no forced continuation.

Consequences:

Captures are easy to foresee and avoid.

A player can usually sidestep threats by moving away from linear alignment.

There is no “tactical avalanche” like in checkers.

➡️ This strongly increases drawishness.

(c) One-step moves only

Pieces move only one step per turn.

No compound moves, no captures that create tempo gains.

This means:

It is hard to force zugzwang.

Players can often “pass pressure” back to the opponent by shuffling.

➡️ One-step-only movement is a classic draw-favoring mechanism in abstract games.

(d) No obligation to capture

Even if a capture is available, it is not compulsory.

Players can decline trades indefinitely.

Compare:

Games with forced capture (e.g. checkers) → decisive.

Games without forced capture (e.g. Fanorona without approach/withdrawal forcing) → draw-prone.

➡️ Players can avoid simplifying into losing endgames.

(e) Draw rule explicitly anticipates stagnation

“If, after a capture, neither player can capture further opponent pieces, the game is a draw.”

This rule:

Codifies dead positions.

Suggests that the game’s traditional form expects mutual blocking.

➡️ Historically, this is strong evidence the game is drawish in practice.

2. Comparison to known games
Game	Capture type	Forced capture	Draw tendency
Ya Gu Qi	Linear custodian	No	High
Nine Men’s Morris	Custodian	No	High
Fanorona	Custodian	Yes	Low
Alquerque	Jump capture	Yes	Medium
Tafl variants	Custodian	Often forced	Medium

Ya Gu Qi sits closest to Nine Men’s Morris–style dynamics, but with less forced interaction.

3. Likely practical outcome

With perfect or near-perfect play:

Early phase: cautious positioning, no captures.

Midgame: occasional voluntary captures if advantageous.

Endgame: blocked positions with no safe alignments.

➡️ Most games between competent players will end in a draw.

With casual or inexperienced players:

Tactical oversights create captures.

Games often end decisively.

➡️ The game is skill-sensitive, but still draw-biased at higher levels.

4. Would it be solved as a draw?

If analyzed computationally:

Small piece count.

Low branching factor.

No hidden information.

➡️ Very plausible that the solved outcome would be draw, or “draw except for blunders”.

This is similar to solved Morris variants and many small custodian-capture games.

5. How to make it less drawish (if desired)

If you are thinking in Ludii / design terms, any of these would reduce drawishness:

Mandatory capture

Multiple captures per move

Win by immobilization

Capture by jumping instead of alignment

Asymmetric setup or unequal piece counts

Bottom line

Ya Gu Qi is very likely a drawish game under optimal play, by design:

Non-forced custodian capture

One-step movement

High symmetry

Explicit draw condition
