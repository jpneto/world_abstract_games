Shuangtian Qi (Double-Field Game)

Shuangtian Qi, also known as Defensive Chess, is a two-player adversarial game. The board of Shuangtian Qi is formed by two “field” (田) shapes rotated 45 degrees and joined together, hence the name “Double-Field Game”.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Shuangtian Qi board has a total of 17 positions. Each player has 8 pieces, distinguished by red/black or black/white pieces. For ease of explanation, the positions are numbered: one group is numbered 1–8, and the other group 10–17. Position 9 is empty at the start.

Each player places their pieces on one side of the board along the same numbered positions, leaving position 9 empty. As shown in the diagram, pieces numbered 1–8 are placed on the left side of the board, and pieces numbered 10–17 are placed on the right side.

2. Movement

The objective of movement in Shuangtian Qi is to exchange the positions of one’s pieces with those of the opponent. The exact positions occupied by individual pieces do not matter.

There are two main types of moves:

Step move:
Move a piece to an adjacent empty position.

Jump move:
A piece jumps over an adjacent piece and lands on an empty position beyond it. The jumped-over piece remains in place; the color of the jumped piece does not matter.

3. Victory Conditions

The two players attempt to exchange their piece positions. A player wins if they successfully complete the exchange of positions; otherwise, they lose.
