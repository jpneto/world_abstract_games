Wuhuqí (Five-Tiger Game)

Wuhuqí, also known as Five Tigers, Fangcheqi, Dabianqi, Xiabián, Sanxing Sì, Wuhuqi, Wumaqi, Changjiangqi, etc., is a two-player abstract strategy game widely played in many regions of China.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Wuhuqí board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 16 squares and 25 intersections.
There are 25 pieces in total: one player has 13 pieces, the other 12 pieces.
The pieces are distinguished by color. Players take turns placing pieces on the board.

2. Scoring and Capturing

Players aim to form specific target patterns.
When a player successfully forms a target pattern, they may capture a fixed number of opponent pieces.
However, pieces that have already formed part of a completed pattern may not be captured again.

Once the board is completely filled, players capture pieces according to the patterns they form.
If neither player can form a target pattern, each player captures one piece.

After this, the first player captures first, then the second player, and afterwards players alternate turns.
