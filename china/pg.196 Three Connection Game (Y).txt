Three-Connection Game (三通棋)
Overview

Three-Connection is a two-player abstract connection game played on a triangular board.
Players take turns placing stones only; there is no movement and no capture.

The objective is to form a connected group of stones that touches all three sides of the board.

Equipment

A triangular board subdivided into a triangular lattice with 64 intersection points.

32 stones for each player, in two different colors.

Setup

The board starts empty.
Players choose a color.
Either player may move first.

Play

Players alternate turns.

On a turn, a player:

Places one stone of their color on any empty intersection of the board.

Stones, once placed, remain fixed for the rest of the game.

Connectivity is defined by adjacent intersections connected by the edges of the triangular grid.

Objective (Winning Condition)

A player wins immediately upon forming a single connected group of their stones that touches all three sides of the triangular board.

Touching a side means that at least one stone in the connected group lies on that side of the board.

Draw

If both players simultaneously complete a connection touching all three sides, the game is a draw.

Notes

This game is a pure connection game, structurally equivalent to Y, played on a finite triangular grid.

There is no capture, blocking is indirect, and the game has perfect information.

The game is expected to be drawless under normal play, except for the explicit simultaneous-completion rule.
