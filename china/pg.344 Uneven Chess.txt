Uneven Chess (参差棋)

Uneven Chess is a two-player abstract game. It takes its name from the uneven outline of the board.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Uneven Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It uses square intersections; the board has seven squares per side, for a total of 49 intersections.

Each player has 7 pieces of a different color. During setup, the players place their pieces on the intersections closest to their own side of the board.

2. Movement

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, a player moves one piece. The number of steps is not limited, but the piece may only move straight forward.

3. Victory and Defeat

Capturing is not permitted in this game.
The player who is the first to move all of their pieces to the opponent’s side of the board wins.

If a player is blocked and unable to move all of their pieces, the opponent wins. There are no draws.

Mutual-Approach Chess (相遇棋)

The rules of Mutual-Approach Chess are similar to those of Uneven Chess; only the board differs.

The Mutual-Approach Chess board is shown in Figure 2. It has a stepped outline and contains 52 intersections. Each player has 8 pieces, distinguished as black and white.

During play, pieces may move only to adjacent intersections, but the number of steps per move is not limited.

The game ends when the final pair of opposing pieces meet; the player whose piece reaches the meeting point first wins. There are no draws.
