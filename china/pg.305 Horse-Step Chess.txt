Horse-Step Chess (马步棋)

Horse-Step Chess is a single-player board game. Its movement is similar to the movement of the horse in Chinese chess (Xiangqi), hence the name.

Game Procedure
◆ Method of Play I
1. Setup

The Horse-Step Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It is formed by the intersections of 5 horizontal and 6 vertical straight lines, creating a grid.

The player uses one piece, which may be regarded as the “horse” from Chinese chess, though it may also be treated as a generic piece. The piece may be placed on any intersection, as shown in Figure 1.

2. Movement

The piece must move continuously without repeating any position and must traverse all intersections on the board.

Movement follows the horse’s move in Chinese chess: one step straight followed by one step diagonally, forming the character “日”.

3. Victory and Defeat

If the player successfully reaches the goal by traversing all intersections, the result is a win.
If the piece cannot continue moving, the result is a loss.

◆ Method of Play II

The player takes 49 pieces. At the start of the game, all pieces are placed on the board formed by the intersections of 7 horizontal and 7 vertical lines.

The player chooses one piece as the starting piece. Each move follows a diagonal direction (as shown in Figure 2). For example, the black piece labeled “1” can move to points A or B; the black piece labeled “2” can move to points C, D, E, or F.

Each time a piece moves to an intersection, one piece is removed.

If the player removes all pieces, the player wins.
If 40 or more pieces are removed, the result is considered a pass.
