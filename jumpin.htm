<p><font size="3" face="Arial">It seems to me that the original rules need some
tuning (a player can force a draw by refusing to move one stone).&nbsp;Jumps
could be mandatory (but with no need to make the longest jump) and stones could
only move backwards if no other movement was available. Stalemate should be a
loss.</font>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Jumpin, published by Minnesota 
	Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), 1964 (author uncredited). Jumpin is 
	played on a 6x11 board. In the handsome original bookshelf edition the two 
	armies are Silver and Gold, and each starts with twelve pawns as shown. The 
	object is to maneuver all your pawns into the opposite home area.<br>
	<br>
	So far this sounds like a version of Chinese Checkers on a square grid, but 
	Jumpin makes an interesting change to the rule of movement. Pawns may not 
	move except by jumping, and a jump consists of leaping over a single pawn or 
	an unbroken line of pawns, in any orthogonal direction. The pawns being 
	jumped can be of either color, and are not removed. The jumping pawn lands 
	on the first vacant square after the jumped pawn(s). Multiple jumps (using 
	the same pawn) are allowed on the same turn.<br>
	<br>
	Since pawns cannot move apart from jumping, a player must be careful not to 
	strand one of his own pawns. Otherwise he will waste considerable time 
	trying to get back to it.<br>
	<br>
	Jumpin needs a slight rule tweak to take care of the possibility of a player 
	refusing to move his last pawn out of his goal area, thereby preventing his 
	opponent from winning. The same problem arises in Chinese Checkers, where 
	one proposal is to require that any pawn in the home area which can jump out 
	of the goal area over an enemy piece must do so. The rule proposed by Sid 
	Sackson, which strikes me as more elegant, is to change the winning 
	condition: a player wins when his enemy's home area is fully occupied and 
	contains at least one of his own pieces. This rule makes the game proceed 
	exactly as it does when both players "play fair."</font></i></p>

swap with an
opponent stone adjacent to it. Note: KO rule applies, a player can't reverse a
swap that was just made by the opponent.</i></font> </p>

play <i>- Medal play is an extension of match play. When one player has
succeeded in getting all his stones to the other side, the second player
continues to place all of his stones, counting and recording the number of moves
it takes him to succeed. After four games, instead of counting the number of
games won, the winner is the player with the lowest score.</i></font></p>
