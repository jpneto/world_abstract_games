isn't perfect as there are full board repetitions after 4 moves. It would be
best if the rule would simply be: It's not permitted to repeat a full board
position during a game.</i></font></p>

    moved regardless of their color or how many.</font>
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">A marble is captured if it is pushed off the
    board. Captured enemy marbles are removed from the board. Captured neutral
    red marbles are placed in the capturing player's storage area.</font>

  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">To win a player must collect seven red
    marbles. It is also possible to win by eliminating all of an opponent's
