<p><font size="3" face="Arial">This game is based on the Pete Abrams' <a href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy

<font face="Arial">
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i>I stumbled across Sluggy Freelance while reading the 
	home page for Plan 9 Publishing (the outlet for another online strip, Kevin 
	and Kell, a strip drawn by one of my favorite cartoonists, Bill Holbrook). I 
	devoured the Sluggy archives from start to the present strip in about five 
	days during my spare time at work and days off. The strip features a 
	homicidal, ass-kicking, switchblade-wielding mini-lop bunny named Bun-Bun. 
	More than a few of the strips feature Bun-Bun beating the pulp out of the 
	other characters. Kiki is a naive, joyful, mildly hyperactive [Editor's 
	note: mildly hyperactive?!], easily-distracted ferret. She provides a kind 
	and childlike presence, a well-used contrast to Bun-Bun's violent, cynical 
	nature.<br>
	<br>
	It's important to understand that Bun-Bun is virtually unbeatable in 
	combat -- there's only one fight that Bun-Bun started and didn't win; that was 
	with a Giger-style Alien, and it ended in a tie. With how easily Kiki can 
	unintentionally annoy anyone, and how defenseless she is, you'd expect 
	Bun-Bun to have ventilated her several times over. He never has. Hasn't even 
	laid a whisker on her. In fact, Bun-Bun frequently uses Kiki as his 
	accomplice for many of his schemes and adventures. This got me to thinking: 
	Here's a bunny with a running vendetta against Santa Claus, for crying out 
	loud. Why hasn't he taken on Kiki? Then it hit me -- perhaps Kiki is one of the 
	few characters who could actually defeat him.<br>
	<br>
	Shortly thereafter, this game was created. From that moment of inspiration 
	to full-fledged completion, I figure it took about 10 minutes.</i></p>
