awkward <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html">Chess rules</a>,

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Read some <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/index/external.php?itemid=AbstractChess">comments</a>
about the game. </font><font face="Arial">One from Peter Aronson is especially relevant:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">[...] on reflection I find myself 
	wondering if the game doesn&#39;t make it too easy to make passive moves. A pair 
	of Knights, for example, could pass back and forth a stone all day without 
	substantially changing the board position. I wonder if a two move approach, 
	as used in many of Ralph&#39;s recent board connecting games might be better. 
	Each player would have two moves a turn: the first is obligatory, and 
	requires moving a stack from one space to another; the second is optional, 
	and consists of moving a stone from one stack to another. Or alternately, 
	maybe a player could be forbidden to make two transfers in a row.  
	Another issue (and this one was illuminated both by Zillions&#39; play and 
	John&#39;s earlier comments) is that the relation between the number of stones 
	in a stack and the power of a stack is very irregular. Two stones are much 
	more powerful than one stone, but three stones are hardly any stronger than 
	two, while four stones are a fair bit stronger than three, and five stones 
	are no stronger than four and six stones are much stronger than five. I 
	wonder about this approach:</font></i></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There are two ZRFs to play the game: <a href="zrfs/abstractChessII.zip">one</a>
by L. Lynn Smith with stack oriented visual, and <a href="zrfs/abstractChessI.zip">another</a>
by Peter Aronson more chess like.</font></p>
