      <font face="Arial">Some words from the author: </font>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Note that on the first move, only one piece is flipped, due to the
      checkerboard setup of the board.  Note also that a winning row is one that
      contains one "group" of color--either all white or all black.  If, at the beginning of a turn, a player has a row that contains two "groups", they
      have a winning move, as one group can always be flipped to match the second (unless this would simultaneously create a winning row for the
      opposite side).  A row with three groups is also a winning row, because the middle group can always be flipped to match the outer groups.  So the
      strategy boils down to reducing the number of groups in one's own rows, and increasing the number in one's opponent's.  Also, it is not necessary
      to have a row containing only two or three groups to win in one move.  For
      instance, if a row consists of three white groups and two single black pieces, it is possible to flip the two black pieces to white, if they are
      on converging diagonals.  Of course, when making a move, the diagonals work against one at least as often as they do in one's favor, and one
      finds oneself saying, "I would move here, except...."  But that's what makes walking through a minefield difficult.</i></font>
