        words: <i>Black's castle shows a rook on the wall facing a defender
        inside. In such a situation both have the right to capture. However, in
        this specific situation only white can capture because the black rook is
        pinned! This position shows one of the basics of attack. If it were
        white's turn he could checkmate in two, so let's assume it's black's
        turn. Let's also disregard the other pieces for a moment and assume the
        postion around black's castle is part of an actual position. What can
        black do? Interposing a piece on any of the squares between the black
        rook and either of the white rooks, would parry the immediate threat. If
        this isn't possible, black's only option is to move the defending rook
        towards the pinning one. But this leaves a white rook on the wall
        attacking three squares inside the castle - literally a thorn in white's
        side. Needless to say that the white rooks illustrate a basic attacking
        pattern. It appears in a variety of forms in almost all attacking
        concepts.</i> </font>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some 
<a href="https://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/1208-chad">words</a> from the author: <i>A basic concept is
the promotion sacrifice. It derives from the fact that an attacker, once he is
inside the castle (and thus automatically a queen), can only be captured by the
King. A King on the side leaves one square unprotected, and a King in the corner
three. The sacrifice of a piece to force the King to the side or into the
corner, to clear the way for a second piece to promote on an unprotected square,
is very common. A queen is worth the sacrifice of a piece anytime! Its strength
is illustrated in the same diagram: if it were black's move, the lone queen
could checkmate the white king in just two moves.</i></font><i> <font size="3" face="Arial">In
positional respect, a rook on a square diagonally adjacent to the enemy castle
covers two segments of the wall. Needless to say these spots are popular.
Finally, every attack eventually draws from defending forces, so a mating attack
should drive home. </font></i></p>

<p> <a href="hexchad"></a></a><font size="3" face="Arial">There's also a hexagonal variant, <b>HexChad</b>
<a href="zrfs/hexchad.zip">
<img border="0" src="icons/z.gif" width="11" height="11"></a>: <i>HexChad is the 
hexagonal variant of Chad, which was first published in The Gamer (May-June 
1982). In Chad the King is confined to his 3x3 castle and may move as either a 
King or Knight. The Rooks can promote to Queens upon reaching the interior of 
the opponent's castle. The attacker can only capture if he's on a castle wall 
capturing inward, the defender inside the castle can only capture an opponent on 
the wall. Other than that, they just block each other.</i> [from Zillions page]</font></p>
