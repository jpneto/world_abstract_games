<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Jul-Gonu
is a type of Gonu, which is one category of Korean traditional board games,
usually played on a board hand-drawn on the ground and with distinguishable
stones, so it can be easily played without any equipments. The name of this game
'Jul' means 'line', for the board is drawn with lines. There are many variants
due to regions. They differ in the size of the board, the number of stones, the
initial position, etc. ... Jul-Gonu can be played on board larger than 4*4, but
it's tiresome. Custodian capture is not the essence. It's all about parity and
forced retreat. And the larger the board, the easier players can avoid
repetition and just playing inside his territory. It's considered 'no manner',
but rule to prohibit this is tricky.</i></font></p>
