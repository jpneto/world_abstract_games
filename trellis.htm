<font face="Arial">Some words from the author: <i>Note that the standard pie
rule is encapsulated within the [game's pie] rule, because it is permissible to
pass a turn. (I.e., Player 1 could play one move for Black, then pass for White,
then pass for Black.)</i></font>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">The original version of 
	Trellis was among the connection games described by R. Wayne Schmittberger 
	in his article, &quot;Making Connections&quot; (June 2000 Games). It took place on a 
	17x17 checkered grid (counting the points rather than the squares), which 
	was divided into adjoined 9x9 quadrants. Five games took place at the same 
	time --- one in each quadrant and one on the full board. The object of each 
	game was to connect the top to the bottom (for Black) and the left to the 
	right (for White). The player who won at least three of these five games was 
	the winner. You played just one stone on your turn.</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Shortly after the article 
	was published, I tried applying the quadrant idea to the game Hex (i.e., 
	Black tries to connect the upper right to the lower left for each quadrant 
	as well as for the full board, and White tries to connect the upper left to 
	the lower right for each quadrant as well as for the full board --- three or 
	more out of five wins). Because of the tension between the two &quot;acute&quot; 
	quadrants and the two &quot;obtuse&quot; quadrants, the strategy of this game was more 
	interesting than that of Trellis, I thought. I also began experimenting with 
	ways to spice up the tactics of Trellis' checkered grid. I came upon the 
	idea of playing two stones at a prescribed distance apart. A three-point 
	separation turned out to be the most appropriate.</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">So the original game of 
	Trellis split into two games: square Trellis (15x15 checkered grid, no 
	quadrants, two stones per turn) and quadrant Trellis (14x14 rhombus board 
	divided into 7x7 quadrants, just one stone per turn). Both were described in 
	my article, &quot;New Connection Games --- Part One&quot; (October 2001 Games). Since 
	then I've chosen square Trellis to be the standard version and changed the 
	name of quadrant Trellis to quadrant Hex, since it is really a Hex variant 
	rather than its own game.</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Important addendum: I've 
	discovered that the essential connective structure of Trellis is that of the 
	game Bridg-It. In both games directly adjacent same-color placements 
	connect, and indirectly adjacent same-color placements connect in 
	color-specific alternation. There are two differences between the games: 
	1)There's a forty-five degree difference in board orientation 2)In Trellis a 
	move consists of two placements, exactly three units apart. Thus if Trellis 
	is played with only one placement per turn, it is equivalent to &quot;Diagonal 
	Bridg-It.&quot; (Consider that stones and bridges are only visual symbols --- 
	what is really placed on a board is a position. So if you rotate a Trellis 
	board forty-five degrees and square it off, you have a Bridg-It board. And 
	if you rotate a Bridg-It board forty-five degrees and square it off, you 
	have a Trellis board.) Bridg-It is a solved game --- a 
	directly-adjacent-point pairing strategy exists for the first player. This 
	explains why upon continued play of Trellis' original version, I began to 
	find its tactics predictable. It also explains why the 
	&quot;exactly-three-points-apart&quot; rule works so well: Because three is an odd 
	number, the directly-adjacent-point pairing strategy is very quickly foiled. 
	(I had also experimented with two-point and four-point separations, which I 
	now see did not work for the reason that even numbers do nothing to prevent 
	directly-adjacent-point pairing.) It was never intended as such, but I 
	suppose Trellis can be viewed as &quot;redeemed Bridg-It.&quot;</font></i></p>
