words for the author:</font> <i><font face="Arial">Aboyne is a game of tactics.
You have to be careful in moving your pieces because if they get too close to
your opponent's you will not be able to move them. You can think of every
piece as a centre of its own forc</font></i><font face="Arial"><i>e field. Once
captured in the force field, a piece will not be able to get away. But this
works in both ways! Also this force field helps you when you want to jump over
you own pieces.</i></font></p>
