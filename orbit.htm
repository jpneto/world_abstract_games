<font face="Arial">Some words from the author: </font>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>there is no Ko in Orbit, the
reason being it is prohibited to play within an opposing structure. For the same
reason, &quot;invasion&quot; is not possible in the usual sense --- however, a
portion of or all of your opponent's structure can sometimes be</i></font><i>
	<font face="Arial">destroyed,
meaning that it is now permissible to play within it since</font>
	<font face="Arial">it
no longer exists. (BTW, it is permissible but never advantageous</font>
	<font face="Arial">to
play within one of your own orbits).</font></i> </p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">In general terms Orbit is 
	a family of 29 Go-like games, all of them playable but some more intriguing 
	than others. The version given here as standard was described in Issue 12 of 
	Abstract Games. It also appeared in November 2001 Games, where it was called 
	Half-prohibition Orbit. (The essential rules can be summed up as, 
	&quot;Half-orbits prohibit, orbits capture and prohibit.&quot;)</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Although stones are 
	captured during the course of the game, Orbit can still be easily played 
	with pen-and-paper. The reason is that captured positions are not 
	subsequently re-occupied --- it is illegal for the captured player to do so, 
	and it is a wasted move for the capturing player to do so. Orbit probably 
	isn't as graceful of a game as Anchor, but if you're the &quot;hardcore&quot; type who 
	likes a maximum challenge, then I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy 
	it.</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Addendum: In case anyone's 
	curious, I thought I'd go ahead and briefly describe the full Orbit family. 
	There are 26 &quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot; variants and three special variants. In Orbit 
	there can be up to three kinds of structures: quarter-orbits, half-orbits 
	and orbits. A given structure can function in one of two ways: prohibit, or 
	capture and prohibit. If you take all the permutations of the existence and 
	non-existence of the structures, and cross that with the two function 
	choices, you get 26 variants. The standard game and &quot;quarter-prohibition 
	Orbit&quot; are among these. The first special variant is Conversion Orbit, which 
	I've renamed conversion Go. The second special variant is the &quot;torus&quot; 
	variant: a regular board is used with the understanding that the left and 
	right sides are connected, and the top and bottom sides are connected. There 
	is only one rule: orbits capture and prohibit. (If you decide to try this 
	one out sometime, remember the following important fact: an orbit is only 
	valid if it is inherently self-connected --- a self-connection resulting 
	merely from the toric nature of the playing area is not a sufficient 
	condition.) The third special variant is as follows: half-orbits prohibit, 
	orbits capture and prohibit --- but all outside liberties must be filled. 
	(Inside liberties do not need to be filled.) So in this variant the 
	mechanism of liberties is partially adopted.</font></i></p>
