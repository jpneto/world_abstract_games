<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140719013500/http:/home.fuse.net/swmeyers/anchor.htm">
words</a> from the author:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">This one is my favorite. (I hope to 
	make a nice wooden board for it at some point, to go with some glass Go 
	stones and wooden Go bowls that I have.) It was presented by Kerry Handscomb 
	in Issue 5 of Abstract Games, in the article &quot;Redefining Life and Death.&quot; 
	The title sounds dramatic, but it just means that the issue of territory is 
	decided differently in Anchor than it is in Go. Instead of occupying 
	liberties to capture opposing groups, you try to prevent your opponent from 
	connecting his groups to two non-adjacent edges of the board, or to two 
	adjacent edges that meet at a &quot;home corner.&quot; As Kerry observed, the 
	designation of alternating home-and-away corners balances the struggle for 
	territory, as well as adding to the game's strategic interest.</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Note: There is a very similar game 
	called HexGo, which was independently invented by Greg van Patten. As with 
	Anchor, the themes of connection and territory are combined on a hexagonal 
	board. Greg's website providing the rules for HexGo is not currently active, 
	but you can e-mail him for information (vanpag@mail.alum.rpi.edu).</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">A word on the issue of symmetry: If 
	the pie rule is not being used in a game of Anchor, the first player can 
	guarantee a draw by playing his first stone on the center point and 
	thereafter mirroring his opponent. To fix this problem I've included a rule 
	which forbids ten or more consecutive symmetric plays. (I've gone ahead and 
	included this rule in all my games, just for the sake of completeness.) The 
	rule is crude yet effective. A more elegant solution to the problem is the 
	one used by Ea Ea for his game Star --- alternating sides are different in 
	length by one unit. I considered doing the same thing for Anchor but decided 
	against it for aesthetic reasons. It turns out that the issue of symmetric 
	play --- and of the power of symmetry-breaking plays --- is fundamental to 
	the realm of abstract games. Some examples: In the game of Go, the mirroring 
	issue is resolved through capture --- one player makes a capture which 
	cannot be symmetrically reciprocated, because one or more stones required to 
	make the capture are no longer on the board. In the game of Y, the mirroring 
	issue is resolved by the shape of the board itself, there is no need for 
	capture. The triangular playing area ensures that any existing symmetrical 
	conditions can be broken at a higher level. The winner of a Y game is in 
	fact the player who breaks symmetry on the highest level (the n level, where 
	n is the number of points/cells per side of the board). He does this by 
	winning two out of the three n-1 games inside it. BTW Y (of which Hex is a 
	special case) is in my opinion the world's single most beautiful game.</font></i></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Handicap system: The pie rule is not used in 
handicap games. Player 1 plays Black, and Player 2 plays the first move as 
White. Depending on the disparity in skill between the two players, from one to 
seven black stones will be on the board to start the game. The stones are 
entered in the following order: H3, C8, M13, H8, C3, H13, M8.</font></p>
