     <summary>About this page</summary>
     <blockquote>
     <p>The following table mainly features minimalist abstract games: typically using limited material types and regular, grid-based boards. It focuses primarily on modern designs from the 21st century. Over the coming years, Sagme's blog will continue to publish weekly posts on older abstract games, which will gradually be added to this collection. [cf. <a href="https://github.com/jpneto/world_abstract_games/commits/main/db.html">latest games added</a>]</p>
     <p>The WAG links are a mix of the old html pages, that I wrote, and rules in pdf/jpg format. These latter rules were found online and were written by many different people. I decided to link to a local copy, given the transient essence of internet websites.</p>
     <p>There is a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/355713/abstract-games-with-unpublishedincomplete-rules">geeklist</a>with abstract games I was unable to find complete rules. Any help is appreciated.</p>
     The columns are sortable. The search box allows users to select rows having (or not having) certain strings, and to include year ranges. For eg, "8x8 >1999 <2005 !BGG" will select all games played on a 8x8 grid between [2000,2004] not indexed at BGG (BoardGameGeek).
