    <p align="left">&quot;<i>The board is called papamu konane (papa means flat
    surface). The game appears to be authentically Hawaiian. It consists of
    capturing &quot;men&quot; for justice and for sacrifice. To this purpose
    black and white pebbles were moved around from hole to hole. The holes,
    especially the central one, the pika, or navel, were inset with human teeth.&quot;</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>&quot;Konane boards across the island don't follow any established
    pattern in size or play. The amount of holes, set in even lines, varies
    between 64 on the low end to well over 250 on the high end, seemingly only
    changing the amount of game time involved. Along the Kohala coast , at
    Kapaloa, a series of identical petroglyph boards are carved at regular
    intervals. They must have served for the first elimination matches in an
    important gambling event for the ali'i: A little further inland, an arena
    still stands, with one enormous, single checkerboard on its dome. Around
    this stage there is plenty of room for betting spectators. This was no doubt
    the final game between champions.</i>&quot; <font size="2">[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100130201803/http:/www.coffeetimes.com/konane.htm">ref</a></font>]</p>

	<p align="center"><i><b><font face="Arial">Anthropological details of Konane
	<br>
	Prof. Michael Ernst</font></b></i></p>
<center>
    <p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Konane was played in preliterate 
	Hawaii [Sizer 1991]. Konane was popular among all classes, and men and women 
	often played together, unlike some other Hawaiian games that were tapu 
	(taboo) among the common people or were played by only one sex [Emory 1924]. 
	Konane was a particular favorite of old men [Buck 1957, 317]. A game 
	sometimes lasted an entire day; in a match, often a large number of games 
	were played before determining the winner [Emory 1924]. Captain James Cook, 
	who in 1778 during his third voyage was the first European to visit Hawaii, 
	described a native game that is clearly Konane:<br>
	<br>
	One of their games resembles our game of draughts [checkers]; but, from the 
	number of squares, it seems to be much more intricate. The board is of the 
	length of about two feet, and is divided into two hundred and thirty-eight 
	squares, fourteen in a row [hence a 14­by­17 board]. In this game they use 
	black and white pebbles, which they move from one square to another. [Cook 
	and King 1784, 312].<br>
	<br>
	Like other indigenous Hawaiian games and sports, Konane declined in 
	popularity after the arrival of Westerners; by 1924, only one 
	ninety­year­old Hawaiian native woman was known to be acquainted with the 
	game [Emory 1924]. In the last few decades, however, native pastimes have 
	begun a resurgence. Today, students in schools emphasizing Hawaiian culture 
	learn to play Konane as early as first or second grade [Kawai`ae`a 1995]. 
	The loss of popularity resulted in part from Hawaiians' enthusiastic 
	acceptance of novel foreign games, but was primarily due to the efforts of 
	Christian missionaries [Mitchell 1982, 180]. The missionaries taught that 
	Hawaiian culture and customs were inferior, eliminated religious practices 
	that permeated games and sports, and criticized adults who engaged in play 
	during daytime ``working'' hours. Missionaries also strove to stamp out 
	games associated with gambling. Hawaiians were ``greatly addicted to 
	gambling'' [Cook and King 1784], and the betting in Konane was sometimes 
	very heavy [Emory 1924], a practice Brigham [1892, 54] says began in the 
	second half of the 18th century. Alexander [1871, 88] calls gambling the 
	chief purpose of Hawaiian games.<br>
	<br>
	Konane was played on a rectangular grid of indentations or holes. (Corney 
	[1896] describes Hawaiian ``draughts''---probably Konane---boards as painted 
	in squares; Andrews [1865] says Konane was played on squares of black and 
	white.) Pitted slabs with rows of holes for playing Konane were found on the 
	front of the platform of many houses [Emory 1924], and portable game boards 
	were common [Buck 1957]; the game was also frequently played on the plaits 
	of the lauhala mat [Emory 1924]. The twenty Konane slabs and boards reported 
	by Emory [1924] and Buck [1957] average 134 holes each, with a geometric 
	mean of 125 holes. The number of rows ranged from 8 to 13, and the number of 
	columns from 8 to 20; five of the boards were square and the remainder 
	rectangular. The board (papa konane) is set end on between the players, with 
	the longer dimension between them.<br>
	<br>
	The center of the board was called piko (navel) and frequently marked with 
	an inset human molar; sometimes every position had an inset tooth (or a 
	chicken or human bone [Brigham 1892, 60]). The row along the borders of the 
	board was termed kaka`i . Before starting play, the board positions were 
	filled with alternating black and white stones. Local beaches provided 
	basalt and coral pebbles for game pieces, whose preferred size was under an 
	inch in diameter and slightly flattened rather than spherical. The names for 
	the black and white stones are variously reported as `ili `ele`ele (black­skinned) 
	and `ili kea (white­skinned) [Buck 1957], as `ili`ili `ele`ele and `ili`ili 
	ke`oke`o [Mitchell 1975], as ka eleele (or ele) and ke keokeo (or kea) 
	[Emory 1924], and as hiu [Andrews 1865].<br>
	<br>
	To begin the game, the players decide who picks up the first stone, which 
	must be the center stone, one laterally next to it, or one at a corner. The 
	second player picks up an adjacent stone of the other color; if the first 
	player selected a stone adjacent to the center, then the second player must 
	take the center stone. Thereafter, the players take turns jumping with the 
	color that each initially picked up, removing jumped­over stones of the 
	other color (lawe ili keokeo, paani, ka eleele: ``removing the whites is 
	playing with the blacks''). The first player unable to move loses (make); 
	the other player wins (ai).<br>
	<br>
	A move consists of jumping (holo or konene) one's own piece over an adjacent 
	enemy piece into an empty location just beyond; the enemy piece is removed. 
	Jumping occurs along a row or file, never diagonally and never in two 
	directions on a single move. Multiple enemy pieces may be removed providing 
	they are all on the same row or file, they are separated by one empty 
	location, and there is a vacant position at the end of the line; such a move 
	is called kaholo. Ku`i (strike back) means to jump over the piece just moved 
	by the opponent, along the same row or file but in the opposite direction.<br>
	<br>
	An alternative name for Konane was mu, and for the board, papamu. Brigham 
	[1906] notes that mu was the name of the official who captured men for 
	sacrifice or for judicial punishment and suggests this name was adopted for 
	the game. Buck [1957] thinks it more likely that this mu, and papamu, come 
	from the English word ``move,'' which Europeans frequently said as they 
	played board games. (The New Zealand Maoris used the name mu for checkers 
	for just this reason.) Andrews [1865] says pahiuhiu was the name of a game 
	like Konane, which is a species of punipeke. A more authoritative Hawaiian 
	dictionary [Pukui and Elbert 1957] states that punipeki is a game similar to 
	Fox and Geese whose game pieces are moved on the board by pushing them with 
	sharp sticks; pahiuhiu (or pahuihui) is a game of throwing darts at a 
	target, or, as a verb, to push a stone with sharp sticks toward a goal. The 
	spelling ``pahuuhiu'' in Murray [1952] appears to be a typographical error.<br>
	<br>
	The ancient Javanese/Malayan game of main chuki or tjuki is similar to 
	Konane in that it is a kind of checkers played with 60 white beans and 60 
	black beans on the 120 points formed by intersections of lines [Wilken 1893, 
	162; Wilkinson 1925, 60]. The English game of Leap Frog is also similar, 
	except that during a move a piece may make any number of jumps, even in 
	orthogonal directions, and the winner is the player who captures the 
	greatest number of playing pieces rather than the one whose opponent is 
	blocked from further moves [McConville 1974].<br>
