<p><font face="Arial">Some variants proposed by David Andrew: <i>You may wish to
try out the following variants: i) playing with 7 rather than 9 horses; ii) when
a piece has been hushed, either that you lose the move altogether or (worse)
that the piece that is hushed is shooed off - to the player's stable; and iii)
you keep the rule of safety, that prevents travelers in their home area being
shooed (off), but allow travelers to leave the home area again, taking the risk
that they will subsequently be shooed off, of course. Or, there may be other
variants that occur to you. </i></font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">What can I do (and not do) in one 
	move?<br>
	<br>
	The general rule here is: If it's not forbidden, it's permitted. Here is an 
	example of a valid 'multiple' move: you capture an opponent's horse, then 
	ride away to a square from which, in the same move, you shoo your opponent. 
	This said, there is the general restriction that: You can't get something 
	for nothing. To illustrate: there is the rule (see dismounting above) that 
	says you cannot hold onto a horse from which you have just dismounted. 
	However you may still want to keep control of the now 'free' horse, ie by 
	'holding' it. To hold onto the horse in a later move, you must use up a move 
	in the game - even if you do not physically move the horse itself. Note: in 
	this case, you would show that you had make the move by specifically saying: 
	'This horse (pointing to it) is held'.<br>
	<br>
	Length of play<br>
	<br>
	We think that Shoo is less demanding than chess but more eventful than 
	draughts (checkers). We, therefore, suggest that time limits are placed on 
	gameplay. If you have a chess clock that could be used. The alternative is 
	to use the rule (which we believe is part of Go) that no move may take more 
	than a minute. If it does, the game is immediately forfeited.<br>
	<br>
	Comments<br>
	<br>
	The authors would be gratified to field questions and get comments and 
	suggestions for improvement. Please contact David Andrew - 'dandrew@varials.swinternet.co.uk'. 
	If you really get into Shoo and are not too far from Leeds or London, a 
	visit to work through the game may be possible.<br>
	<br>
	Variants<br>
	<br>
	You may wish to try out the following variants: i) playing with 7 rather 
	than 9 horses; ii) when a piece has been hushed, either that you lose the 
	move altogether or (worse) that the piece that is hushed is shooed off - to 
	the player's stable; and iii) you keep the rule of safety, that prevents 
	travellers in their home area being shooed (off), but allow travellers to 
	leave the home area again, taking the risk that they will subsequently be 
	shooed off, of course. Or, there may be other variants that occur to you.
