<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The goal is stated this way to
prevent that players keep some of their stones on their own base, to achieve trivial draws.
However, other trivial draws are still possible, check the second example. In
this case, a further fix to the goal must be added. A proposal from <a href="mailto:ploog@mathematik.hu-berlin.de">David
Ploog</a> is the following:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>&quot;A player wins if he
  cannot move any of his stones nearer to the opposing corner and if all of his
  stones left his base.&quot;</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Then he adds: [...] use
&quot;nearer&quot; with respect to geometric distance of cells. So if one player has a piece
trapped while his opponent doesn't, then he may as well resign. If both players
have pieces trapped the games is drawn because neither of them will open a path
for his opponent. In any case it is a bad idea to keep pieces behind on purpose.
[...] The aesthetic point is this: When you declare a game as won when the base
is full (regardless of inhabitants) you cover still not all possibilities. Hence
there's need of another rule. But I tried to state this additional in such a way
that it also covers ordinary games.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ralf Gering notes<i>: I would like
to describe another solution to the problem which is known in Germany for at
least half a century: &quot;<u>If one player has left his base, the other player
must also leave his base (or move towards the exit of his base). Other moves are
not permitted</u>.&quot; The beauty of this solution is that the original
winning condition of Halma remains unchanged.</i></font></p>

 is played on a 9x9 square board: Both players start with the first two rows filled

either to an empty square, which ends the turn, or to a square with an opponent piece.
In the latter case, the piece must make another jump or jumps (there is no
capturing) until it lands on an empty cell. Winner is who has all his stones at the two rows at the opposite of

stones on the second row can be placed at any column where they are diagonally
adjacent to the first row stones). Stones
move diagonally forward and can jump diagonally over stones of either color
(jumps can be multiple and are not mandatory). A piece which performs a jumping
move, whether single or multiple, is allowed to make an additional diagonal
step. All steps and jumps are forward only. The first four rows of each side is
considered the camp of that player.&nbsp; No piece may be moved into an enemy
camp while their are still friendly pieces in their own. Wins the player that first
occupies the last row, and place the remaining three stones at the penultimate
row.</font></p>
