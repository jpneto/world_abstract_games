	<p align="justify"><i>Outwit, published by Parker Brothers 1978 (does anyone 
	know the inventor's name?)<br>
	<br>
	This is a fine game, but it has gone out of print. You can still get it on 
	eBay from time to time, and it's usually cheap. Or one could easily 
	improvise equipment (this may be a reason so many good games go out of 
	print).<br>
	<br>
	A board is shown at right. Each side has nine pieces, which in the Parker 
	Brothers implementation are wooden disks stained dark and light. Eight of 
	them are undifferentiated, and the last piece (called the "power piece") has 
	a yellow dot painted on it.<br>
	<br>
	The pieces begin on the dots that run diagonally down the 9x10 board, with 
	the power pieces in the center on the larger dots. The light and dark 
	squares in the corners are the goal squares for each side; the object of the 
	game is be the first to move your pieces into your goal square. Once a piece 
	enters the goal area it may not leave again. No piece may enter the 
	opponent's goal area.<br>
	<br>
	The power pieces move as chess queens, any number of squares orthogonally or 
	diagonally but without jumping over a piece. The ordinary pieces move as 
	runaway chess rooks; that is, they can move in any orthogonal direction, but 
	they must move to the farthest legal square in that direction: that is, the 
	last square before the edge of the board, or before the edge of the 
	opponent's goal area, or before a piece. Thus the power piece's ability to 
	stop short in the middle of the board makes it useful as a barrier for your 
	own pieces -- it would be terrible strategy to move it into the goal area 
	before the endgame.</i></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The game was also named
<a href="https://escaleajeux.fr/?principal=/jeu/afri2?">L'Africa</a>
in France.
</font>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">I do find a structural problem in Outwit. A
player can force a draw, by surrounding the enemy base with his own stones. For
e.g., the moves i1-d1, h2-d2, g3-d3, a9-a4, b8-b4, c7-c4 cannot be easily
defended by the second player, which will be able only to enter his own King on
his base.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Several possibilities to avoid this problem can
be used. Two of them might be:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Adjacent enemy stones, may jump each other, to
    the opposite cell.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Lines of adjacent stones may push adjacent
    enemy lines of stones, like in <a href="abalone.htm">Abalone</a>. If this
    would force an enemy stone to enter the player's base, the player could pick
    that stone and place it on any empty cell. </font><br>
  </li>
