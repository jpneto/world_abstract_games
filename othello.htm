    <i>The origin of Othello is not known. We have not seen any proof of rumors that Othello arose from an old Chinese game called ``Fan Mian'' (claimed in
    E. O. Harbin, &quot;Games of Many Nations&quot;, Abingdon Press, 1954).
    Lewis Waterman and John W. Mollett (both of London, England) both marketed
    games with similar rules in 1880. Mollett's game was called Annexation and
    was played on a cross-shaped board. Waterman's game was called Reversi and
    played on the familiar 8x8 square board. It is unclear whose version came
    first, but Waterman's board and name are in use today. </i>The official 
	rules are

	here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Othello is one the most popular abstract 
	games in the net. A twin game is <b>Reversi</b> where the board begins empty, and both players
    alternate in dropping the 4 stones in the center board square.</font></p>

<a name="SacrificeReversi"></a>Another variant, called <b>Sacrifice Reversi</b> (by <a href="mailto:pduff@airmail.net">Patrick
Duff</a>) with an extra rule: Instead of making a regular Reversi move, a player
can choose to flip one of his own stones on board. There's also a KO rule to
avoid repetitions.</font></p>

(let's call it <b>Reveega</b>) on a NxM board. First phase, play just like

custodian captures). When both players reach a sterile position, wins who 
captured more stones.</font></p>

	intervening. The sandwiched enemy pieces are flipped, changing colour. If 
	one player can't move, he must pass his turn. The game ends when neither

<img border="0" src="icons/z.gif" width="11" height="11"></a>, a 2006 game by 
Vincent Everaert mixes Othello with 
the Fanorona rule of approach:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">44 pieces are randomly dropped on the </i>[Fanorona]<i> 
	board. A piece may move one position along a line. It may capture by 
	approach: after it moves, an enemy piece (or an unbroken string of enemy 
	pieces) adjacent to it along its line of movement are taken. It may instead 
	capture by withdrawal: if it begins its move adjacent to an enemy piece (or 
	unbroken string) and moves directly away, the enemy piece(s) are taken. 
	Captured pieces are flipped. Capturing is not mandatory if a simple move is 
	possible. A piece that just captured may make another capturing move, though 
	it must change directions with every capture and (in this version) it may 
	not immediately return to the point it just occupied. A piece may stop any 
	time after making one or more captures, but at the start of the turn must 
	play a capture if one exists. At the end of a capturing move, the capturing 
	piece is removed from the board. The object is to capture all of the 
	opponent's men or to stalemate them.</i></font></p>

<p><a name="oddthello"></a><font face="Arial"><b>Oddthello</b> (uncredited and undated game) is a

first three rows. Pieces move like Chess queens, and captures are either by replacement 
(the captured piece is removed) or by short jump (the jumped piece is flipped). 
Captures are not mandatory but can be multiple. Captures by replacement are not 
allowed if both pieces are adjacent. Wins the player that reduces the adversary 
army to six or less pieces. However, if the player is reduced to exactly five 
pieces, he still has one turn to respond.</font></p>

	center. Then, starting from the second player, the players alternate by 
	dropping stones on the remaining eight cells in the central 3x3 area. Then 
	the game is played in the outer area. Captures are like Othello, flipping enemy stones. When both players pass, players get 
	points for their stones: one point per stone at the outer area, three points 
	in the inner eight cells, and nine points for the central square. Wins the
