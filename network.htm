<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><a href="mailto:ploog@mathematik.hu-berlin.de">David
Ploog</a> comments: <i>We've played this game a lot; the decided advantage for
the starting player certainly exists. Thus the second player will find himself
defending throughout the drop phase. Therefore he tries to combine this with
attacking moves. This is the fun of the game. </i>[...]<i> Perhaps the board
should be 10x10 or 12x12 (and the connection longer) in order to offset the
advantage a bit.</i></font></p>
