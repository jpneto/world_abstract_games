- by growing, a plant may fuse with another friendly plant; (b) <i>massive
trimming</i> - by removing a grain, a part of the plant may be without contact
to a seed, and so it is removed from the board; (c) <i>separation</i> - a plant
with more than one seed may separate in two.</font></p>

plant parasites and fast grow) which I believe are optional and do not add much
