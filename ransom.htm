King of "liberties", often by driving it to the edges or corners and forcing it up against his own pieces.</i></font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>It is a simple game, but it has some good qualities:  simple,&nbsp;
fast-paced, a good degree of "tension".  I chose the name Ransom, because in order to threaten your opponent's
King, you often have to&nbsp; jeopardize your own.  This is similar to a kidnapping situation, which is a
species of "prisoner's dilemma", in which you have to make a difficult choice between risk/payoff.  Regardless of how well Ransom works, this
risk/payoff choice is a good way of achieving tension in a game, and tension is one thing that makes some games better than others.  Another thing I like
about Ransom is the fact that pieces are "transparent" to &quot;friends&quot; -
that you can jump our own pieces, but not your opponents.  This is a way of heightening the drama of a game, similar to those chess variants where the
turn order is 1 move for white, 2 for black, 3 for white, and so on, or Shogi type games where captured pieces change sides.  By allowing pieces to
pass through their friends, a single move has both an offensive and a defensive component, a threat and a block.  I mention these things not so
much to point them out in regard to Ransom, but to show how I think about games, how I judge them, and what I would hope to accomplish by creating a
matrix of win conditions, move rules, capturing rules, etc.  For instance, one idea not used in Ransom, or in any game that I know of, is what I call
the "handcuffed opponents" idea.  I considered the possibility of the Kings in Ransom being "handcuffed" together, so that if the white King moved, the
black King automatically moved to the square just vacated by the white King.  Similar but not quite the same as the "ball and chain" game where pieces
of the same color are chained together.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After some play testing I believe that the King has too
much mobility and it can easily escape any enemy attack. Perhaps a way to fix
that would be to decrease the King movements (e.g., just orthogonal moves).</font></p>
