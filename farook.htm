	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">FAROOK™, © Stewart Lamie, 
	1993, Patent Pending (as of then, don't know what's happened since I bought 
	the game), bills itself as &quot;The ULTIMATE Tic-tac-toe&quot;. It is an impressive 
	abstract strategy game, having been selected as a Mensa Mind Game and been 
	on the Games 100 list. </font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">FAROOK is for two players. 
	The game is contained in a small felt pouch. The pouch, when opened, reveals 
	the playing board, a grid of 4 by 4 squares, with decorative spots around it 
	for the playing pieces. The playing pieces are 14 small polished stones: 6 
	dark, 6 light, and 2 smaller wild stones, which are neutral. The object of 
	the game is to get 4 of your stones into a winning pattern. A winning 
	pattern can be made up of stones entirely of your color, OR it can include 
	wild stones. But the catch here is that a wild stone can also be used by 
	your opponent at the same time. </font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Players begin by taking 
	turns each placing one of their stones, or a wild stone, onto the playing 
	board. Eventually all 14 stones will be played. At this point, each player 
	in turn must move a stone into one of the empty squares. A stone may be 
	moved to an adjacent empty square, or there are rules for jumping over 
	another stone to an empty square. A player may also move a wild stone in 
	some instances. The rules state that you have only 1 minute in which to make 
	your move. To win, you must get 4 of your/wild stones into a row, square or 
	corners. If no player wins after 50 moves, the game is declared a draw.
	</font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">While it is not discussed 
	in the instructions, I believe it is possible to create a situation where 
	one player moves a wild stone in a way that creates a winning combination 
	for each player. I assume this would also be considered a tie. </font></i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">I brought FAROOK to and 
	played it at one RG several years ago. My first opponent beat me in less 
	than 5 minutes. My second opponent and I played to a draw and declared 
	ourselves brain dead afterwards. I have not played FAROOK since, though my 
	enjoyment of the game has not diminished. </font></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>As you might expect, there 
	is a computer version of FAROOK. I have never seen it sold commercially, but 
	I do remember seeing it advertised in shareware catalogs several years ago. 
	The original FAROOK computer game had 7 levels of mastery. One company in 
	New York City, AMUSE INC., offered a $1000 prize to anyone who could beat 
	their computer playing FAROOK at the Champion level. I wonder if they ever 
	had to pay the money? </i>[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040308005422/http:/mid-hudson.us.mensa.org/text/199811.htm">ref</a>]</font></p>
