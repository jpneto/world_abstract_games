<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some comments from the author: </font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Kechi is a game of pure strategy for two 
	players. The game-board is a criss-cross of rows and columns of thirteen 
	squares, and the game pieces consist of two sets of four pawns of different 
	color (the example drawings included use &quot;B&quot; for black and &quot;W&quot; for white) 
	and a set of eighty-eight markers of an off color (the example drawings 
	represent those markers with an &quot;X&quot; across the squares they mark). Capture, 
	as in chess, is by replacement. Victory is established, as in checkers, by 
	being the last player capable of making a valid move. A unique factor of the 
	game is that once a piece starts a move from a given space, that space 
	cannot be occupied. </i>[...]</font></p>
	<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Play
testing has shown that neither player holds an advantage, and movement later in
the game becomes a challenge as spaces become exhausted by movement and by
captures. Losing two pieces also severely restricts freedom of movement. Several
variants have been suggested:</i></font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Other board shapes might also be used to
    change the complexion of play. Larger boards, rather than smaller ones, are
    suggested, since smaller boards tend to more heavily favor one player or the
    other. It is quite possible to design smaller boards that force a win by
    either player.</i></font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>On a larger board, it becomes possible to
    add more pieces to each side.</i></font> </li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Rather than having a fixed movement limit
    of six squares, the movement limit might instead be determined by die roll.</i></font>
		</li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Rather than leaving the board empty and
    drawing an &quot;X&quot; on the used squares, the board could start covered
    with tokens; movement must be to a square with either a token or an
    opponent's piece. Doing so, an alternate victory condition becomes possible:
    The one who has the most tokens and opponents' pieces by the game end wins.</i></font></li>
