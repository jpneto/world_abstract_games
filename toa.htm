    <p align="left"><i><font face="Arial">Claude had an idea of a pivot moving after seeing 
	<a href="scalus.htm">Scalus</a> pivot scaling concept. After some discussions with the abstract games
    community, we designed a game based on what Claude named by Twirls. A Twirl
    is a kind of cooperative move. An isolated stone is not able move, it always
    needs the 'help' of another one, in order to move through the abstract board
    where the game flows. Of course, the game was also inspired by the <a href="loa.htm">Lines
    of Action</a> abstract game, and that reflects on the game's name!</font>&nbsp;</i></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Twirls of Action is played on a 9x9 or 
	8x8 Go board. </font></p>

				<li><font face="Arial">A
            valid Twirl may have stones between the pivot and the destiny cell.
            This implies that Twirl move may be irreversible! As Claude says,
                  this makes move orders important, makes the board more like a puzzle than
            a gas, makes the game more like an adventure than a clean equation,
            and gives us more ideas to plan with a sharper responsibility.&nbsp;</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial">The
            connection restriction was defined to create a harder winning goal
            for both players. Otherwise, the game is too fast and easy for the
            1st player.&nbsp;</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial">For
            a harder game, people may like to restrict it to a maximum of 2
            adjacent stones</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial">This
            also can be altered to define handicaps. A weaker player can win by
            creating chains with 4 neighbors, and the stronger player must
            create chains with at most 2 neighbors!.</font></li>
