<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some
words from the author: <i>	The first player should concentrate on forming
circles, while the second attempts lines.  The triangle will often become a threat that can be exploited for positional
advantage by both players. Remember there are three different colors which can be played.  Use more than one to
perform blocking moves.  If an opponent seems to favor one color, you can take advantage by playing the other
two.	Just because you can replace a stone does not mean that it is wise to do so.  In fact it might be advantageous to secure that stone by placing more of its color
adjacent. If an opponent successfully blocks a developing pattern, don't be afraid to abandon it.  In fact, either start a new one somewhere else on the field or begin building on the opponent's blockers.  In either case, try switching
colors. Watch out for those triangles, they can sneak up and hinder a developing
pattern.</i></font></p>
