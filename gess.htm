<blockquote>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">&#38598;&#22243;&#38499;&#24418;&#26827; (Shudan-Jinkeiki) (Troop-Chess) is an 
	abstract game for two players, which can be played using components from 
	other games (such as Go, Chess, Shogi). In Troop-Chess, players organize 
	battle-formations with their pawns and use these formations in both offence 
	and defense.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">The game can be played in three versions, each 
	using groups of three, five or eight pawns. A player can take action only if 
	they have organized a battle-formation using the specified number of pawns.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">For this reason, a player who has reduced their 
	pawns to fewer than the specific number, or has divided them too small, 
	making it impossible to organize any formation, will lose the game. It is 
	possible that both players get incapacitated at the same time, because they 
	have reduced their pawns too much simultaneously. In this case, the game 
	ends in draw.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">Each type of battle-formation has its own nature, 
	such as strong in attack or highly maneuverable. One formation has only 
	mobility. As well as the predefined formations, you can create original 
	battle-formations as you like. And modify the number of pawns that are used 
	too.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">Each pawn does not have any nature by itself, but 
	the power or strength of the formation organized from pawns is affected by 
	its relationship with the neighboring pieces.</font></i></p>
	<p align="center">
	<img border="0" src="icons/Troop_chess.jpg" width="360" height="360"></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">What is required to determine this is only a method 
	to judge which are allies or enemies.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font face="Arial">Further, whilst in the original game, each pawn has 
	no nature itself, the designer encourages players to customize the game 
	further by introducing specialized pawns.</font></i></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i><b>Go-Chess Rules of Play<br>
	</b><br>
	<b>Object.</b> The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent&#8217;s king.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Board and Pieces.</b> The Go-Chess playing board is a 10 x 10 matrix of 
	squares, alternately colored light and dark. Ten randomly chosen squares on 
	the matrix are &#8220;blocked off&#8221; (colored black). Every board is different, 
	since a different set of ten squares is blocked off for each new game. 
	Unlike chess, there is no directionality to the board, i.e., no home side 
	for either player. Each player has a standard set of chess pieces, one white 
	and the other black. The pieces move and capture just as in chess, except 
	that pawns can move one rank or file at a time in any direction and can 
	capture an opposing piece that is one diagonal square away in any direction. 
	No piece can be moved onto a blocked off square. Queens, bishops and rooks 
	cannot pass over a blocked off square.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><b>The Piece Placement Phase.</b> There is no 
	predetermined initial position for any piece. Instead, the play phase of the 
	game is preceded by a piece placement phase, where the players select the 
	initial positions for all their pieces. To begin this phase, each player 
	selects an initial position for a pawn without revealing it to the opponent. 
	Any square that is not blocked off is eligible. After both players have made 
	their selections, the two pawns appear on the chosen squares simultaneously. 
	Then the two players place their second pawns in the same fashion, selecting 
	any available squares. The remaining pieces are then placed in the same way, 
	in the following order: all eight pawns, then the two bishops, then the two 
	rooks, then the two knights, then the queens, and finally the kings. Bishops 
	must be placed on squares of opposite colors.<br>
	<br>
	If ever the two players choose the same square for the pieces they are 
	placing, they must select new positions for them but neither may choose that 
	square. If once again they make the same choice, they must select yet 
	another square and may not choose either of the two squares they previously 
	tried. This process continues until the two pieces have been placed on 
	different squares, with the stipulation that none of the squares previously 
	attempted for that piece are permitted. The slate of ineligible squares is 
	cleared for the next pair of pieces to be placed.<br>
	<br>
	Kings may not be placed in check. If the kings are placed such that neither 
	is checked by a previously placed piece but they check each other, they must 
	be placed again and neither player may choose a position previously 
	attempted for his king. A player may select a square the opponent has 
	attempted for his king as long as the player himself has not attempted to 
	place his king there.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><br>
	<b>Determining the First Player.</b> Unlike chess, white does not 
	automatically move first. Instead, the player whose king and queen are 
	closest together moves first. Distance between pieces is determined by 
	adding the number of ranks they are apart to the number of files they are 
	apart.<br>
	<br>
	If the king-queen distances are equal, the player whose king is closest to 
	his nearest knight moves first. If that distance too is the same, distances 
	between kings and other knights determine the first player. If those 
	distances are again the same, the determinant is distance between kings and 
	nearest rooks, then kings and other rooks, then kings and nearest bishops, 
	then kings and other bishops, then kings and nearest pawns, then kings and 
	next nearest pawns, etc. If none of these criteria determines a first 
	player, white moves first.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><b>The Play. </b>Play commences and proceeds as in 
	chess, the players taking turns until one checkmates the other or a draw is 
	reached according to the standard rules of chess. There is no castling, no 
	pawn promotion, no initial two-square move option for pawns, and no en 
	passant capture. Stalemate is a draw, as in chess. If both players make 
	identical pairs of moves three times in a row, the game is a draw. A draw 
	can be declared at any time by mutual agreement, where either player offers 
	a draw and the other accepts. </i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><b>Go-Chess Hints on Play</b></i></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>It pays to examine the board layout and begin 
		developing a strategy before placing even the first pawn, although 
		inevitably this strategy will have to be adjusted as your opponent 
		places pieces.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>It is suggested that players begin by planning 
		possible locations for their kings and queens, bearing in mind that the 
		player whose king and queen are closest together plays first&#8212;a distinct 
		advantage. You might plan for the eventuality that the kings and queens 
		are equidistant by plotting locations for your knights that are close to 
		your king, since distance from kings to knights are the &#8220;tiebreaker&#8221; 
		when the kings and queens are equidistant. Seldom are second and third 
		level &#8220;tiebreakers&#8221; required, and so distance between kings and rooks, 
		bishops, and pawns should not play important roles in your strategy to 
		gain first move advantage. However, it often makes sense to pack a 
		number of pieces around your intended square for the king for defensive 
		purposes.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>It may not be wise to count on being able to place 
		your king on a single square, since it is too easy for the opponent to 
		anticipate this strategy and foil it by placing a piece of his own on 
		this square or by checking it. It is better to plan a &#8220;pocket&#8221; of 
		several protected squares where the king might be placed, or even two 
		pockets.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>One piece placement strategy is to be mostly 
		defensive, packing most of your pieces around the intended square for 
		the king. However, you might consider trying to anticipate your 
		opponent&#8217;s strategies and attempting to foil them by placing pieces of 
		your own amidst the opponent&#8217;s &#8220;camp,&#8221; as long as this does not entail 
		undue sacrifice to your own position. Since foiling a strategy often 
		comes at a price&#8212;placing a piece where it can be easily captured&#8212;the 
		merits of doing so should be carefully weighed. Placing your eighth pawn 
		in the middle of a pocket your opponent has developed might make sense, 
		whereas placing a more valuable piece there might not.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>The relative value of pieces is not the same as in 
		chess, and in fact varies from board to board based on patterns of 
		blocked off squares. A board with many open ranks and files adds value 
		to rooks. If a preponderance of blocked off squares are of one color, 
		bishops on squares of the other color are very valuable. Knights are 
		very powerful since only they can cross blocked off squares, which might 
		be the best way &#8212; or even the only way &#8212; to attack a well-protected 
		king.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>If you feel sure your opponent is about to select 
		a certain square for the next piece to be placed, consider selecting the 
		same square. If indeed you both choose that square, he will have to make 
		another choice. The effect is to foil his plan at no sacrifice to your 
		own. The danger, however, is that he will make a different choice and 
		your piece will wind up poorly placed.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>Consider placing pieces on squares where they are 
		protected by previously placed pieces. Note that since there is no 
		directionality to the board, pawns may be placed in self-protecting 
		pairs.</i></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><i>Think twice before resigning even after giving up 
		a substantial material advantage. The peculiarities of a particular 
		board might allow you to prevent checkmate despite the disadvantage. For 
		example, experienced chess players automatically resign at the end of a 
		game where their king is up against a king and a rook. In Go-Chess, 
		blocked off squares might offer sufficient protection to prevent your 
		opponent from checkmating you in that end game situation. </i></p></li>
