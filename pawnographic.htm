<p><font face="Arial">Bill Taylor wrote in May 2003: </font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">This [about another] 
game, with its emphasis on pawns, reminds me of one we used to play quite a bit 
- &quot;all pawn chess&quot;. The players just start with their pawns on the usual place 
and no pieces and no kings. Pawns move as usual, including e.p, and the winner 
is the first to promote a pawn, or you lose by being first unable to move.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">[...] When we used to play this back in student 
	days [Bill was 58yo in 2003], one of the chaps, a chess expert, claimed that 
	one of the positions that arose had an opportunity for a genuine sacrifice. 
	That is, giving up a pawn, without immediate chance of regain, for a 
	longer-term advantage. We were all a bit dubious though.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Independently, <a href="mailto:ingen@ukendt.dk">Michael
Jørgensen</a>, had almost the same idea, which he called <b>Touchdown</b>,
played on a board with 4 rows and 8 columns (but it may change to any size)
where the stones start in the first and last row, and a stalemate means a draw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">An excerpt of the original
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.games.design/c/RE4O80XqbYQ/m/Nglqr-25dgMJ?hl=pt-PT">post</a> (c.2003)</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The game is played on a board with 4 rows and 8 
	coloumns like this (view using a fixed-width font):<br><br>OOOOOOOO<br>........<br>........<br>XXXXXXXX<br>
	<br>The pieces move like pawns in chess, i.e. move forward one square at a time, 
	but capture diagonally. The winner is the first player to reach the opposite 
	side of the board with a pawn. It is obligatory to move if possible. If a 
	player has no more moves, the game is a draw (a tie).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dvd Avins answered: </font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">Michael Jørgensen may well have come up with 
	this independently, but it is very nearly a non-chess representation of a 
	chess puzzle I developed and have been showing at clubs and tournaments for 
	the past 20 or so years. The only difference in outcome would be that in the 
	chess puzzle, if neither player can move then the player whose turn it is 
	loses. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The position is: White has its king on g1 and 
	pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f6, and h6. Black has its king on g8 and pawns on 
	a7, b7, c7, d7, f3, and h3.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The queenside is exactly as Mr. Jørgensen, 
	except that I&#39;m not sure whether he&#39;s accounting for en passant captures 
	when he says the &quot;pieces move like pawns in chess&quot;. Any move on the kingside 
	loses quickly for whoever made the move, so the game must be settled on the 
	queenside (which is the Touch Down board). However if neither side can move 
	on the queenside, in chess a losing move on the kingside is forced.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The chess puzzle is a win for White. If the 
	number of queenside columns with pawns is reduced to three, then it is a win 
	for Black. With Michael Jørgensen&#39;s rule allowing a draw in the case of 
	locked pawns, I suspect that the game is a draw.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The winning strategy for White in the chess 
	puzzle is to move a &#39;center-pawn&#39; (i.e. the b- or c-pawn) two spaces, then 
	in response to most Black tries to move the opposite wing pawn (i.e. the 
	d-pawn after the b-pawn or the a-pawn after the c-pawn) on space, then to 
	move the remaining center-pawn two spaces.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">Anyway, given the two accounts (Bill&#39;s and Avins&#39;) it 
seems this game floated among game clubs (namely Chess clubs) many decades before the 2000s.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another modern iteration of this concept is 2001&#39;s
