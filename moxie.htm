(which 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023064546/http:/home.flash.net/~markthom/html/moxie.html">described</a>
the game) says:<i> </i></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>It looks to me as though White can make a first move on a
central square and win pretty quickly; I'm not even sure the game would
consist of anything other than onboarding and capturing.&nbsp; But I haven't
analyzed the game completely yet. Possible variants suggest themselves:&nbsp;
what if jumps took priority over any other move except a move to win, or to
avoid immediately losing?&nbsp; Or if a player with a jump available could make
a different move at the expense of sacrificing one piece of his own choice?&nbsp;
What if the object were to achieve a row of three that could not be broken up by
the opponent's next move?&nbsp; How would it play if the object were to
achieve some different pattern?&nbsp; Would some of these variants play better
if the movement power were changed -- perhaps to a knight move?&nbsp; How would
the natural hexagonal variation (onto a board of 19 hexes) play?</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">I agree with Mark. A slight advantage is enough
to win this game. The player can produce many threats that enable him to capture
the required six stones. Another possible variants: allow only for diagonal 3
in-a-rows, a player that captured six enemy stones would lose (that's nasty!), or
even, a player would have an extra turn after an opponent 3 in-a-row in order to
remove the winning pattern.</font></p>
