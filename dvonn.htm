<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Some words from the author:&nbsp;</font></p>
<table border="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
      <ul>
		<li><i><font size="3" face="Arial">When placing the
            pieces on the board, make sure that you put enough of them at the
            edge and close to the DVONN pieces. In the beginning of a game it is
            important to have pieces at the edge because you may not play with
            the pieces that are surrounded at all 6 sides. Having pieces close
            to the DVONN-pieces can be important to control them in a later
            stage of the game.</font>&nbsp;</i></li>
		<li><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Don't put too many of
            your pieces close together. However, having a cluster of pieces in
            the centre of the board may give you the opportunity to separate the
            piece on one side of the board from the pieces on the other side.
            Sometimes that can be very powerful - but only sometimes!</font>&nbsp;</i></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>When making a move,
            you neutralize an opponent's piece each time you play on top of one.
            A neutralized piece is like a piece that is captured (it remains in
            play, indeed, nonetheless it is one piece less for your opponent to
            play with).</i></font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Try to keep as many
            of your pieces mobile. Keep in mind that the higher a stack gets,
            the more difficult it becomes to move.</i></font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Be careful when your
            opponent is in control of a DVONN piece. Check where he can go to
            with the DVONN piece and how many of your pieces will have to be
            removed if he moves it. If it is too dangerous, then try to
            immobilize the stack by making it higher.</i></font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>The last moves are
            very important. Often the player with the most mobile pieces at the
            ending stage of the game will eventually win. In other words: try to
            make your opponent pass his turn before you must do so yourself.</i></font></li>
