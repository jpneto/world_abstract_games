<p><font size="3" face="Arial">I placed this game on the Towers section, since
there are 3 types of pieces that can be emulated by stacks of different sizes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some strategy tips from the author: </font><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>(a)
Get your strike pieces in as quickly as possible adjacent to the opponent's
centrepiece - thereby reducing his movements and paralysing his pieces. (b) Use
both your strike and support pieces to scatter your opponent's groups by
displacing his pieces to the ends of your lines. (c) Make sure that when you
attack you attack to great effect - otherwise you’ll be left too close to your
opponent's pieces, and your pieces will be scattered on the next turn.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The old site [http://www.scat.demon.co.uk/reviews/fibonaci.htm] 
where more info was available is gone, so here's a text output:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">Fibonacci is a fast and furious two-player tactical 
game, and unlike a large proportion of the strategy games on the market, I am 
pleased to say that this is NOT a chess variant. In fact, Fibonacci has little 
relationship to any other strategy game I have played...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">I should point out that there is a variation of 
Fibonacci which involves the use of cards, and which introduces an element of 
luck into the game. Although the cards are supplied with Fibonacci, I must 
confess that I haven't played this version of the game, and I will say no more 
about it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The board is hexagonal, divided up into hexagonal 
spaces (forgive me if I occasionally laps into calling them 'squares'). Each 
player starts the game with 13 pieces; one centrepiece, six attacking ('strike') 
pieces, and six neutral ('support') pieces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The objective of the game is to completely surround 
your opponent's centrepiece with your attacking pieces.<br>The centrepiece cannot move itself, but can be moved by other pieces of either 
side. All other pieces move in exactly the same way... a piece can either move 
to any adjacent hexagon, or it can move to any hexagon adjacent to another piece 
to which it is connected. This is best seen with the help of the following 
diagram...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; _/ \_/x\_/ \_/ \_<br>&nbsp; / \_/x\_/x\_/ \_/ \<br>&nbsp; \_/x\_/2\_/x\_/ \_/<br>&nbsp; / \_/1\_/3\_/4\_/ \<br>&nbsp; \_/x\_/x\_/x\_/ \_/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; \_/x\_/x\_/ \_/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \_/ \_/ \_/<br>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">If a player has pieces in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, then 
a piece at position 1 can move to any of the positions marked with an 'x', since 
1, 2, 3 are connected.<br>If a piece moves to a square... er... hex which is already occupied, then the 
two pieces exchange places. This occurs regardless of who owns the piece on the 
destination hex.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">One final twist... a player gets to move several 
pieces during their turn. The first player makes one move, the second player 
two, the first player then moves three... until the dizzying total of six moves 
is reached. After that, each player takes six moves each turn. However, a player 
loses one move for each of their opponent's attacking pieces which is in contact 
with their centrepiece.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The movement rules make this game very fast-moving, 
with pieces flowing backwards and forwards across the board, there is plenty of 
scope for lightening strikes, eg building a ladder to the enemy centrepiece, and 
transporting it to the opposite end of the board.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">The sheer number of possibilities, however, reduces 
the value of long-term planning; on an average turn, each piece would be next to 
about 5 other pieces, giving about 14 possible positions for each piece. If you 
multiply this by the number of pieces able to move (12), then you have 168 
possible moves. Assuming that you have four moves in an average turn, this gives 
168 x 168 x 168 x 168 = about 800,000,000 possible moves per turn. Compare this 
to about 39 moves from an average position in a game of chess!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New">I would say that this game is a must for any serious 
strategy game player, and the pace of the game and movement of the pieces should 
appeal to casual boardgamers too.</font></p>
