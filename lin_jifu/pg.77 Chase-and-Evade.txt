### Game Procedure

**1. Setup**
The Chase-and-Evade board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 23 square grid points.
The two players use black and white pieces. Black has 11 pieces, and White has 12 pieces, which are arranged on the board as shown in the illustration.

**2. Removal (Opening action)**
After the game begins, Black moves first.
Black selects any one of White’s pieces and removes it from the board, leaving that point empty.

**3. Movement**
Players then take turns moving, with Black moving first.
A move must follow the grid lines, either horizontally or vertically, to an adjacent empty point. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

**4. Winning**
Both players aim to surround the opponent’s pieces.
When one player completely surrounds the opponent’s pieces so that they have no legal moves, that player wins.
