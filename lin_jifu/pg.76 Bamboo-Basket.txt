### Game Procedure

**1. Setup**
The Bamboo-Basket board is shown in Figure 1. It has a total of 19 points (positions).
Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by black and white.
Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty points of the board.
The setup phase ends once all pieces have been placed.

**2. Movement**
After setup, players take turns moving, one move per turn.

**3. Capturing**
Captures are made by encirclement.
When a player’s pieces surround an opponent’s piece so that it has no path to escape, that opponent piece may be captured and removed from the board.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, there are two types of captures: edge capture and central capture.

**4. Winning**
The first player to capture 2 of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.
