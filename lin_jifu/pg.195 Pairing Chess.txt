Pairing Chess (对子棋)

Pairing Chess is a two-player abstract strategy game. It is called Pairing Chess because each player places two stones per turn.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Pairing Chess board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 36 cells and 49 intersection points.

The two players take turns placing stones. On each turn, a player places two stones, which may be placed on any empty intersections on the board.
However, the two stones placed in a single turn must be adjacent to each other and may not be separated.

Stones may be placed either horizontally or vertically.

3. Win/Loss

If a player is unable to continue placing stones according to the rules, that player loses.
If both players are unable to place stones according to the rules, the game is a draw.
