Tug-of-War Chess (拽王棋)

Tug-of-War Chess is a two-player abstract board game. Pieces are captured by pulling.

Game Procedure

1. Setup
The Tug-of-War Chess board is shown in Figure 1 and has a total of 53 intersections. One player takes the black pieces and the other the white pieces.

Black has 6 pieces

White has 10 pieces

At the start, all black pieces are placed at the top of the board, and all white pieces are placed along the bottom edge of the board.

2. Movement
Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player makes one move.

3. Capturing
Capturing in Tug-of-War Chess is done by pulling, as shown in Figure 2.

If a black piece A moves to point A, it captures the white piece at point A.

If a white piece A moves to point B, it captures the black piece at point A.

White pieces may not capture black pieces by pulling from the black player’s starting area.

4. Victory Conditions

Black wins by pulling its pieces to reach the bottom edge of the board.

White wins if it makes the black pieces unable to move.
