Capture Chess (吃子棋)

Capture Chess is a traditional two-player confrontation game. At the beginning of the game, the objective is to capture pieces; survival then becomes the objective, hence the name of the game.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Capture Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of the intersections of five horizontal and five vertical straight lines, for a total of 25 points. The board is square in shape.

Each player has 10 pieces. The pieces of the two players are made of different colors or different materials so that they can be distinguished.

Before the game begins, each player places their 10 pieces on the 10 points closest to their own side of the board.

2. Movement

Before the game starts, one player holds 1 piece or an empty hand and challenges the opponent. If the opponent guesses correctly, the opponent moves first.

The player who moves first must choose a piece color. Thereafter, the two sides alternately move their own pieces. Each turn, a player may move only one piece, and each move consists of one step.

3. Capturing

After one side moves a piece, if that piece encounters an opponent’s piece, it may jump over that piece and capture it. The captured piece is then removed from the board, as shown in Figure 2.

4. Victory and Defeat

The game ends when one side’s pieces have all been captured.

Discussion

Capture Chess is similar to Go to a certain extent. Chen Zhiyuan notes in A History of the Evolution of Go Rules:

“Capture Chess determines victory and defeat by killing the opponent or by counting the number of pieces killed. However, as skill levels rise, if one side only seeks survival, it becomes very difficult to kill them. This can gradually cause the objective of play to shift from capturing pieces to living. In that case, living on the board becomes increasingly important. Capture Chess emphasizes capturing, while living without being captured is also a form of capturing; thus, capturing and living are two aspects of the same thing. The transition from focusing on captured pieces to focusing on pieces that cannot be captured is a natural one in terms of logic. From Capture Chess, with capturing as the objective, to Go, with living as the objective, the first stage of Go’s development is thus completed.” ①
