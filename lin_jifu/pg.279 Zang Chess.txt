Zang Chess (藏棋)

Zang Chess, also known as Many-Eye Chess (多眼棋) or Multi-Eye Chess (多目棋), is popular in western China and is a Go-type board game.

Zongzang Zhaba notes in A Guide to Tibetan Travel:

“In world chess history, Zang Chess can be said to be ancient and unique. Whether compared with ‘Tianjiu’ (Six-Piece Chess), ‘Geziluo’ (Cross Chess), or ‘Jiajiajiu’ (Hand-Position Chess), it both absorbs the cultural essence of other ethnic groups’ chess traditions—simple, ingenious, and interesting—and also possesses its own distinctive methods and techniques.”

Zang Chess can be played by two, four, or six players simultaneously. In ancient times it was mainly popular among the aristocracy; today it is commonly played among the general population, and is especially widespread in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The Zang Chess board is shown in the figure. It is generally a 17 × 17 Go board.

Before the game begins, 12 pieces are placed on the board, with 6 black and 6 white. These are called the “base pieces” (座子).

2. Movement

White moves first. After both sides have placed the 12 pieces, normal movement begins. Each move consists of one step.

3. Capturing

When three pieces form a straight line, the player may capture any one of the opponent’s pieces.

When one side has only 3 pieces remaining, that side may ignore the one-step movement restriction and move pieces freely, as long as the player tries to arrange them into a straight line.

4. Victory and Defeat

The game ends when one side’s pieces have all been captured.
