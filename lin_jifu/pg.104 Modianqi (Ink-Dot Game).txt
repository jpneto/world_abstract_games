[This is almost Dots and Boxes]
Modianqi (Ink-Dot Game)

Modianqi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is somewhat similar to Bridg-It.

Game Procedure

1. Board

The board of Modianqi consists of 100 ink dots, that is, 100 individual points arranged in a grid of 10 rows by 10 columns, as shown in the diagram.

2. Connecting Lines

Players take turns drawing a line between any two dots on the board; each turn, one line is drawn.
Lines may be drawn horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally, and no line may be drawn more than once.

The purpose of drawing lines is to enclose four dots to form a square.

3. Victory

Within a square, the boundary edges may consist of lines drawn by either player.
However, the player who draws the final edge completing the square claims ownership of that square.

Additionally, if a line segment between two dots serves as the shared side of two adjacent squares, it must still be drawn.

Players may use two different markers to distinguish the squares they have claimed.
The game ends when no more moves are possible; the player who has claimed more squares wins.
