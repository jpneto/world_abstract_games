<pre>Bamboo-Basket Game (筜箕棋)

Bamboo-Basket Game is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay 
is similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

1. Setup

The Bamboo-Basket board is shown in Figure 1. It has a total of 19 points
(positions). Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by black and white.
Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty points of the board.
The setup phase ends once all pieces have been placed.

2. Movement

After setup, players take turns moving, one move per turn.

3. Capturing

Captures are made by encirclement.

When a player’s pieces surround an opponent’s piece so that it has no path
to escape, that opponent piece may be captured and removed from the board.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, there are two types of captures: edge capture 
and central capture.

4. Winning

The first player to capture 2 of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Chase-and-Evade Game (追随棋)

1. Setup

The Chase-and-Evade board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 23 square grid points.
The two players use black and white pieces. Black has 11 pieces, and White has 12 pieces, 
which are arranged on the board as shown in the illustration.

2. Removal (Opening action)

After the game begins, Black moves first. Black selects any one of White’s pieces and 
removes it from the board, leaving that point empty.

3. Movement

Players then take turns moving, with Black moving first. A move must follow the grid lines, 
either horizontally or vertically, to an adjacent empty point. Diagonal moves are not 
allowed.

4. Winning

Both players aim to surround the opponent’s pieces. When one player completely surrounds 
the opponent’s pieces so that they have no legal moves, that player wins.

Plum Blossom Chess (梅花棋, Méihuā Qí)

Plum Blossom Chess is a forming-pattern-type confrontational game with 
gameplay similar to Gather Chess (聚会棋, Jùhuì Qí). Both sides take 
turns placing pieces, with the goal being to form the target pattern 
shaped like a plum blossom. The plum blossom patterns are shown in 
Figure 3 and include the following types:

    Upright Small Plum Blossom (正小梅花) - (Top Left)

    Slanted Small Plum Blossom (斜小梅花) - (Top Right)

    Upright Large Plum Blossom (正大梅花) - (Bottom Left)

    Slanted Large Plum Blossom (斜大梅花) - (Bottom Right)

The game ends when there are no empty positions left on the board. 
The side with the highest final score wins. Additionally, when placing 
a plum blossom, one should try to construct the "Double Plum Blossom" 
(双梅花) shape, as shown in Figure 4, which doubles the score.

2. Hexagonal Chess (六角棋, Liùjiǎo Qí)

The gameplay of Hexagonal Chess is also similar to Gather Chess, 
but the board is different. The Hexagonal Chess board and target 
patterns are shown in Figure 5.

Liudaoqi (Six-Path Game)

Liudaoqi, also called Dafangqi, Insert-Dafang, or Swing-Dafang, is played 
in a way similar to Gobang (Five-in-a-Row). It is a two-player abstract 
strategy game that is popular and widely spread among the people.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The board of Liudaoqi is shown in the diagram: it has 25 intersections 
and a total of 36 playing lines. Each player has 33 pieces, which may be 
round or of other shapes. Players take turns placing pieces on any empty 
intersection except the center point, until the board is completely filled.
Any remaining pieces are kept as reserve pieces.

2. Capturing

During the placement phase, players must place their pieces so as to form 
one of the target patterns. 

If a player forms a target pattern, they capture pieces equal to the 
number specified by that pattern.

If the player forms multiple target patterns at once, they may capture 
a corresponding number of pieces.

After the board is completely filled, players continue capturing according 
to the patterns they form.

If neither player can form a target pattern, they alternately capture 
one piece; this is called “passing” (通子).

The target patterns in Liudaoqi include:

Dragon:
    Six connected horizontal or vertical lines.
    Four of the intersections must be inside the board, and the other two
    must be on the edge.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Six-Slash (also called “Diagonal Slash” or “Through Slash”):
    Six connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Five-Slash (also called “Five-Slash Child”):
    Five connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Four-Slash (also called “Four-Slash Child”):
    Four connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Three-Slash (also called “Three-Slash Child”):
    Three connected diagonal lines, with two of the intersections on the 
    board edge.
    Capture 1 piece.

Square (also called “One-Square” or “Large Square”):
    Capture 1 piece.

3. Movement

When no more captures are possible, both players move pieces.
Each move consists of moving one piece by one step only.

During movement, if a player forms one of the above target patterns, they 
capture the opponent’s pieces according to the capture rules and add the 
corresponding number of pieces to their own supply.

If the newly added pieces also form a target pattern, no additional 
capture is made.

4. Victory

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Variants / Related Games (链接)

Liuzhouqi, also called Fangzhou, Anliu, Swing Six, Lailiu, etc., 
uses the same board and pieces as Liudaoqi, but the rules are simpler.
There are only two target patterns:

Chengliu (also called Shangliu or Chengpai):
Six pieces connected in a straight line horizontally or vertically.
Captures 2 pieces.

Chengfang (also called Shangfang):
Four pieces forming a square on the board.
Captures 1 piece.

The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent’s pieces; 
that player is the winner.

<pre>Modianqi (Ink-Dot Game)

Modianqi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is somewhat similar to Bridg-It.

Game Procedure

1. Board

The board of Modianqi consists of 100 ink dots, that is, 100 individual points
arranged in a grid of 10 rows by 10 columns, as shown in the diagram.

2. Connecting Lines

Players take turns drawing a line between any two dots on the board; each turn, 
one line is drawn. Lines may be drawn horizontally or vertically, but not 
diagonally, and no line may be drawn more than once.

The purpose of drawing lines is to enclose four dots to form a square.

3. Victory

Within a square, the boundary edges may consist of lines drawn by either player. 
However, the player who draws the final edge completing the square claims 
ownership of that square.

Additionally, if a line segment between two dots serves as the shared side of 
two adjacent squares, it must still be drawn.

Players may use two different markers to distinguish the squares they have claimed.
The game ends when no more moves are possible; the player who has claimed more 
squares wins.

Wuhuqí (Five-Tiger Game)

Wuhuqí, also known as Five Tigers, Fangcheqi, Dabianqi, Xiabián, Sanxing Sì, 
Wuhuqi, Wumaqi, Changjiangqi, etc., is a two-player abstract strategy game 
widely played in many regions of China.

1. Setup

The Wuhuqí board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 16 squares and 
25 intersections. There are 25 pieces in total: one player has 13 pieces, 
the other 12 pieces. The pieces are distinguished by color. Players take 
turns placing pieces on the board.

2. Scoring and Capturing

Players aim to form specific target patterns.
When a player successfully forms a target pattern, they may capture a 
fixed number of opponent pieces. However, pieces that have already formed 
part of a completed pattern may not be captured again.

Once the board is completely filled, players capture pieces according 
to the patterns they form. If neither player can form a target pattern, 
each player captures one piece.

After this, the first player captures first, then the second player, 
and afterwards players alternate turns.

(Diagram caption: Wuhuqí board)

Target Patterns in Wuhuqí

Five Tigers (also called Five Nests):
    Divided into central tiger and edge tiger.
    Five connected pieces in a horizontal or vertical line.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Tongtian (also called Great Tiger or Large Tiger):
    Five connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Small Well (also called Square, Small Square, or Little Well):
    Four pieces forming a square.
