<pre>Bamboo-Basket Game (筜箕棋)

Bamboo-Basket Game is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay 
is similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

1. Setup

The Bamboo-Basket board is shown in Figure 1. It has a total of 19 points
(positions). Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by black and white.
Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty points of the board.
The setup phase ends once all pieces have been placed.

2. Movement

After setup, players take turns moving, one move per turn.

3. Capturing

Captures are made by encirclement.

When a player’s pieces surround an opponent’s piece so that it has no path
to escape, that opponent piece may be captured and removed from the board.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, there are two types of captures: edge capture 
and central capture.

4. Winning

The first player to capture 2 of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Chase-and-Evade Game (追随棋)

1. Setup

The Chase-and-Evade board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 23 square grid
points. The two players use black and white pieces. Black has 11 pieces, and
White has 12 pieces, which are arranged on the board as shown in the
illustration.

2. Removal (Opening action)

After the game begins, Black moves first. Black selects any one of White’s
pieces and removes it from the board, leaving that point empty.

3. Movement

Players then take turns moving, with Black moving first. A move must follow the
grid lines, either horizontally or vertically, to an adjacent empty point.
Diagonal moves are not allowed.

4. Winning

Both players aim to surround the opponent’s pieces. When one player completely
surrounds the opponent’s pieces so that they have no legal moves, that player
wins.

Juhuiqi (聚会棋)

Juhuiqi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is similar to
Dingziqi (peg-connection games).

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Juhuiqi board is shown in Figure 1.
Each player has 18 pieces of a distinct color or shape.
Players take turns placing one piece at a time. Pieces may be placed on any
empty position on the board.

2. Scoring

As shown in Figure 2, when a player’s pieces form a target shape, that player
scores points. Specifically, the score awarded for each target shape is as
follows:

Plum Blossom Chess (梅花棋, Méihuā Qí)

Plum Blossom Chess is a forming-pattern-type confrontational game with 
gameplay similar to Gather Chess (聚会棋, Jùhuì Qí). Both sides take 
turns placing pieces, with the goal being to form the target pattern 
shaped like a plum blossom. The plum blossom patterns are shown in 
Figure 3 and include the following types:

    Upright Small Plum Blossom (正小梅花) - (Top Left)

    Slanted Small Plum Blossom (斜小梅花) - (Top Right)

    Upright Large Plum Blossom (正大梅花) - (Bottom Left)

    Slanted Large Plum Blossom (斜大梅花) - (Bottom Right)

The game ends when there are no empty positions left on the board. 
The side with the highest final score wins. Additionally, when placing 
a plum blossom, one should try to construct the "Double Plum Blossom" 
(双梅花) shape, as shown in Figure 4, which doubles the score.

    Figure 4: Double Plum Blossom Pattern (two points each)

2. Hexagonal Chess (六角棋, Liùjiǎo Qí)

The gameplay of Hexagonal Chess is also similar to Gather Chess, 
but the board is different. The Hexagonal Chess board and target 
patterns are shown in Figure 5.

Liudaoqi (Six-Path Game)

Liudaoqi, also called Dafangqi, Insert-Dafang, or Swing-Dafang, is played 
in a way similar to Gobang (Five-in-a-Row). It is a two-player abstract 
strategy game that is popular and widely spread among the people.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The board of Liudaoqi is shown in the diagram: it has 25 intersections 
and a total of 36 playing lines. Each player has 33 pieces, which may be 
round or of other shapes. Players take turns placing pieces on any empty 
intersection except the center point, until the board is completely filled.
Any remaining pieces are kept as reserve pieces.

2. Capturing

During the placement phase, players must place their pieces so as to form 
one of the target patterns. 

If a player forms a target pattern, they capture pieces equal to the 
number specified by that pattern.

If the player forms multiple target patterns at once, they may capture 
a corresponding number of pieces.

After the board is completely filled, players continue capturing according 
to the patterns they form.

If neither player can form a target pattern, they alternately capture 
one piece; this is called “passing” (通子).

The target patterns in Liudaoqi include:

Dragon:
    Six connected horizontal or vertical lines.
    Four of the intersections must be inside the board, and the other two
    must be on the edge.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Six-Slash (also called “Diagonal Slash” or “Through Slash”):
    Six connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Five-Slash (also called “Five-Slash Child”):
    Five connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Four-Slash (also called “Four-Slash Child”):
    Four connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Three-Slash (also called “Three-Slash Child”):
    Three connected diagonal lines, with two of the intersections on the 
    board edge.
    Capture 1 piece.

Square (also called “One-Square” or “Large Square”):
    Capture 1 piece.

3. Movement

When no more captures are possible, both players move pieces.
Each move consists of moving one piece by one step only.

During movement, if a player forms one of the above target patterns, they 
capture the opponent’s pieces according to the capture rules and add the 
corresponding number of pieces to their own supply.

If the newly added pieces also form a target pattern, no additional 
capture is made.

4. Victory

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Variants / Related Games (链接)

Liuzhouqi, also called Fangzhou, Anliu, Swing Six, Lailiu, etc., 
uses the same board and pieces as Liudaoqi, but the rules are simpler.
There are only two target patterns:

Chengliu (also called Shangliu or Chengpai):
Six pieces connected in a straight line horizontally or vertically.
Captures 2 pieces.

Chengfang (also called Shangfang):
Four pieces forming a square on the board.
Captures 1 piece.

The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent’s pieces; 
that player is the winner.

<pre>Modianqi (Ink-Dot Game)

Modianqi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is somewhat similar to Bridg-It.

Game Procedure

1. Board

The board of Modianqi consists of 100 ink dots, that is, 100 individual points
arranged in a grid of 10 rows by 10 columns, as shown in the diagram.

2. Connecting Lines

Players take turns drawing a line between any two dots on the board; each turn,
one line is drawn. Lines may be drawn horizontally or vertically, but not 
diagonally, and no line may be drawn more than once.

The purpose of drawing lines is to enclose four dots to form a square.

3. Victory

Within a square, the boundary edges may consist of lines drawn by either player. 
However, the player who draws the final edge completing the square claims 
ownership of that square.

Additionally, if a line segment between two dots serves as the shared side of 
two adjacent squares, it must still be drawn.

Players may use two different markers to distinguish the squares they have
claimed. The game ends when no more moves are possible; the player who has
claimed more squares wins.

Wuhuqí (Five-Tiger Game)

Wuhuqí, also known as Five Tigers, Fangcheqi, Dabianqi, Xiabián, Sanxing Sì, 
Wuhuqi, Wumaqi, Changjiangqi, etc., is a two-player abstract strategy game 
widely played in many regions of China.

1. Setup

The Wuhuqí board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 16 squares and 
25 intersections. There are 25 pieces in total: one player has 13 pieces, 
the other 12 pieces. The pieces are distinguished by color. Players take 
turns placing pieces on the board.

2. Scoring and Capturing

Players aim to form specific target patterns.
When a player successfully forms a target pattern, they may capture a 
fixed number of opponent pieces. However, pieces that have already formed 
part of a completed pattern may not be captured again.

Once the board is completely filled, players capture pieces according 
to the patterns they form. If neither player can form a target pattern, 
each player captures one piece.

After this, the first player captures first, then the second player, 
and afterwards players alternate turns.

(Diagram caption: Wuhuqí board)

Target Patterns in Wuhuqí

Five Tigers (also called Five Nests):
    Divided into central tiger and edge tiger.
    Five connected pieces in a horizontal or vertical line.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Tongtian (also called Great Tiger or Large Tiger):
    Five connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Small Well (also called Square, Small Square, or Little Well):
    Four pieces forming a square.
    Capture 1 piece.

Three-Slash (also called Small Slash):
    Three connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 1 piece.

Four-Slash:
    Four connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 2 pieces.

3. Victory

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

扎枪扯萝卜 (Zhaqiang Che Luobo)

Zhaqiang Che Luobo is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is 
similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

Game Procedure

1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 25 cells, with 36 intersection 
points. The two players take turns placing their pieces, starting with Black.

2. Forming “Radishes” and “Spears”

When three pieces form a small right-angled shape occupying three vertices of 
a small square, this configuration is called a “radish” (萝卜).

If one player places a piece on the fourth vertex of that small square, the 
piece captures the radish.

After capturing a radish, the capturing player uses their own pieces to occupy 
the three intersections vacated by the opponent.

When three pieces form a straight line, this is called a “spear” (枪架).

If the opponent has one piece on that straight line, it is considered blocked (扎枪).

In this case, the player may capture an entire row of pieces, and then re-place 
pieces at the top of the board.

3. Victory Conditions

When all intersection points on the board are filled, the game ends.
The player who has more pieces on the board wins.

砖格棋 (Zhuān Gé Qí)

Zhuan Ge Qi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

Game Procedure

1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It is a large square subdivided internally
into 32 small rectangles, with a total of 57 intersection points.

Each player has 10 pieces, distinguished by color or shape. Players take turns
placing pieces, starting with Black. Placement continues until all pieces have
been placed.

2. Moving Pieces

After all pieces are placed, the two players take turns moving.
On each turn, a player may move one piece by one step.

3. Capturing

When one player’s pieces form a target pattern, that player may capture the opponent’s pieces.

The target patterns in Zhuan Ge Qi include:

the “口” (square) shape
the “十” (cross) shape

If a “口” shape is formed, the player may capture any one of the opponent’s
pieces.

If a “十” shape is formed, the player may capture any two of the opponent’s 
pieces — one of which must be the piece that just moved. One piece is decided by the current player, and the other is decided by the adversary.

4. Winning the Game

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Er Chi Yi, also known as “Two Capture One”, “Four Squares”, or “Four-Step Top”, 
is a two-player abstract strategy game.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 16 cells with 25 intersection
points. Each player has 5 pieces. During setup, players take turns placing
pieces, and all pieces must be placed on the row of intersections closest to 
the player.

2. Movement

After setup, players take turns moving.
On each turn, a player may move one piece by one step.

3. Capturing

Figure 2 = capture.

As shown in Figure 2, when one player has two pieces on the same line, 
and there is one opponent piece adjacent on that line, the opponent’s piece 
may be captured (at that moment, there are three pieces on the same line).

This capture is called “top” (顶吃) and is similar to capturing in Tic-Tac-Toe.

Figure 3-6 = no capture.

However, there are several special configurations in which capturing is not
allowed:

If, after moving, the configuration “Two Blacks, One White” appears on the same
line, the white piece cannot be captured (see Figure 3).

If there is an empty space between the two black pieces and the white piece, the 
white piece cannot be captured. The 3 stones should be adjacent. (see Figure 4).

If the two black pieces are adjacent to the white piece, the white piece cannot 
be captured. Only O-O-X, no O-X-O. (see Figure 5).

If, after a move, although the two black pieces and the white piece are on the 
same line, there is another piece elsewhere on that line, then the white piece 
still cannot be captured (see Figure 6). Their can't be irrelevant stones on that line.

4. Winning the Game

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins.

Related Games

1. 着棋子 (Zhuo Qi Zi)

    Also called Four-in-a-Row, this game has rules identical to Er Chi Yi, differing only in the board.

    The board has 9 cells and 16 intersection points.
    Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by color or shape.
    Gameplay follows the same movement and capture rules as Er Chi Yi.

2. 推大车 (Tui Da Che)

    Also known as “Pushing the Cart”, this is a two-player abstract game with 
    gameplay similar to Er Chi Yi.

    The board consists of 9 cells with 16 intersection points.
    Each player has 4 pieces, initially placed on the row of intersections 
    closest to the player.

    During play, in addition to “top” captures, if one player’s two pieces form
    a straight line with two opponent pieces, the player must capture one of
    their own pieces closest to themselves; this is called “pushing the cart”.

    The winner is the player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces.

六子冲棋 (Liu Zi Chong Qi)

Liu Zi Chong Qi, also known as Chongqi, Arrow Chess, or Cannon Chess, 
is a two-player abstract strategy game widely played in Sichuan and Hubei.
Each player has six pieces, hence the name “Six-Piece Chong.”

Game Procedure

1. Board Setup

The board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 9 cells with 16 intersection
points. Each player has 6 pieces, distinguished by black and white.

Players alternately place their pieces as follows:

Four pieces are placed on the four intersections of the bottom row.

Two pieces are placed on the left and right ends of the row just above the
bottom row.

2. Movement

Players take turns moving.
Pieces may move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but only one step at
a time. Jumping over other pieces is not allowed.

3. Capturing

Capturing occurs mainly in three situations, as shown in Figure 2.

(1) Two-against-one (二打一)

When three pieces form a straight line, and two adjacent pieces belong to one 
player, while the third end point is empty, if the other end is occupied by an
opponent’s piece, that opponent’s piece may be captured.

(2) Two-against-two (二打二)

When four pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging to 
one player, and both ends occupied by opponent pieces, the player may capture
both opponent pieces.

(3) Cannon Capture (挑吃)

If a player inserts one of their pieces between two opponent pieces, and 
one end of the line is empty, the player may capture the two opponent pieces.

After making a capture, the capturing piece may then move one step horizontally 
or vertically, and may continue capturing using the cannon capture method.

4. Winning the Game

A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces, or by blocking 
the opponent so that none of their pieces can move.

If both players are reduced to one piece each, and neither can capture 
the other, the game is a draw.

Related Game

五道棋 (Wu Dao Qi)

Also called Five-Line Chess.

The board is formed by five vertical and five horizontal straight lines, 
creating 25 intersection points.
Each player has 5 pieces, as shown in Figure 3, placed on the five 
intersections closest to their side.

The rules for movement, capturing, and winning are the same as 
in Liu Zi Chong Qi.

(Peng Xiangqi, Zhang Xueqi, He Yujian)

--------- Mingyang Tian (lk758tmy) comments:

Stones can only be moved orthogonally, and can't be moved diagonally.

Besides, when a player only have one stone left, that stone can be moved as many 
steps you want in the same direction (like Rook in Chess).

I'm not sure with the capturing rule of this game. The text does not match the 
figures exactly. (For instance, according to the text, only figure3 is counted 
as Two-against-two, and figure4 is not.) And the rules I found on the internet 
said other things.

It's the common status of many folk games: rules varies among regions, and only 
locals know the exact rules they play. (Rules on the Internet are always a "mix" 
of different local rules, and may contradict itself.)

杀蜀黍 (Sha Shu Shu)

Sha Shu Shu is a two-player abstract strategy game that is widely played 
in the Bazhong–Nanchong–Guang’an region of Sichuan.

Because the pieces placed on the board resemble the drooping heads of 
ripened sorghum (蜀黍) after harvest, the game is also known as Sorghum 
Chess, Harvest Sorghum Chess, or Cutting Sorghum Chess.

In areas where Sha Shu Shu is popular, people often sing the following rhyme:

“I’ll teach you a tune,
 I’ll teach you a little game,
 I’ll teach you the southern Sichuan Sha Shu Shu.”

Game Procedure

1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 25 cells with 36 intersection
points. Each player has 18 pieces, distinguished by color or shape.

Players place their pieces on the three rows of intersections closest to their
own side.

2. Movement

Pieces move along diagonal lines only, one step per move.
Moving along straight (horizontal or vertical) lines is not allowed.

3. Capturing

If one of your opponent’s pieces is located on an adjacent intersection 
directly opposite yours along a diagonal, you may capture that piece.

4. Winning the Game

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces first wins.

Xiàliù Qí (下六棋)

Xiàliù Qí, also called Xiàliù, is a two-player abstract board game popular 
in the Jiangsu region of China. It developed from ancient Liùbó (Six Bo) 
and is believed to have spread during the Three Kingdoms period, especially 
in the Huai River basin of Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu.

Gameplay

1. Setup

The Xiàliù Qí board is shown in Figure 1 and consists of 36 intersections. 
Each player has 6 pieces. The two players sit opposite each other.

Each player places their 6 pieces on the row of intersections closest to 
them, with one piece occupying each intersection.

2. Movement

The two players take turns alternately. Pieces move either horizontally 
or vertically, and each move is limited to one step. Only one piece may 
be moved per turn.

3. Capturing

Capturing is divided into five main cases:

Minor capture (小吃):
Three pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging to 
one player and the piece at the other end belonging to the opponent. 
The opponent’s piece is captured.

Major capture (大吃):
Four pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging 
to one player and the other two belonging to the opponent. Both opponent 
pieces are captured.

Complete capture (全了):
When six pieces lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, the player 
may freely capture any two opponent pieces.

Advanced capture (夹吃):
If two pieces are on the same horizontal or vertical line and sandwich 
one opponent piece between them, that opponent piece is captured.

Center capture (掏心):
If one piece occupies the center point between two opponent pieces on 
the same horizontal or vertical line, the two opponent pieces are captured.

After a capture, one player continues until no further captures are 
possible, then the turn passes to the opponent.

4. Winning Conditions

A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces or by rendering 
the opponent unable to make any legal move.

If both players are left with one piece each and neither can capture the 
other, the game is a draw.

Linked Variant
Xiàsì Qí (下四棋)

Xiàsì Qí, also called Xiàsì, is a two-player abstract game popular in 
the Jiangsu region.

Its board differs from Xiàliù Qí, as shown in Figure 2. Each player has 
four pieces, placed on the row of intersections closest to them, with 
one piece per intersection.

Movement, capturing, and victory conditions are the same as in Xiàliù Qí.

Huànwèi Qí (换位棋) — “Position-Swapping Game”

Huànwèi Qí is a two-player abstract strategy game. The objective for each 
player is to move all of their own pieces to the starting area of the 
opponent, hence the name “Huànwèi Qí” (“Position-Swapping Game”).

Huànwèi Qí is similar in spirit to Shànxiàn Qí (Single-Line Chess), 
differing mainly in the number of board spaces and pieces. Because of 
this, there are also differences in jumping and capturing, but the basic 
rules are largely the same.

Gameplay
1. Setup

As shown in the diagram, the Huànwèi Qí board consists of a single row 
of 18 small squares.

Each player has 5 pieces, distinguished by black and white. Players place 
their 5 pieces on opposite ends of the board. There must be no empty squares 
between a player’s own pieces.

2. Movement

The player to move is determined by agreement or by lot, and the two 
players then alternate turns.

On each turn, only one piece may be moved, and it may only move forward, 
never backward.

If a piece encounters an opponent’s piece and there is an empty square 
immediately beyond it, the moving piece may jump over the opponent’s piece 
and land on the empty square. No matter how many opponent pieces lie in 
between, they may all be jumped over, but jumps may not be chained 
consecutively.

A player may not jump over their own pieces. If a player’s own piece is 
blocking the way ahead, the player must wait until the blocking piece 
moves before pieces behind it may advance.

3. Winning Conditions

The first player to move all 5 of their pieces to the opposite end of 
the board wins.

</ul>

As with most traversal games, an extra rule is necessary to prevent drawish strategies. Something like: if the five extreme squares are all occupied while the player already has none of his at the first five squares, then that player wins the game.

Lúnxíng Qí (轮行棋)

Lúnxíng Qí is a two-player abstract board game. The board has numbered 
spaces, and the two players move alternately in rotation, hence the name 
“Lúnxíng Qí” (“Rotational Movement Chess”).

Gameplay
1. Setup

The board of Lúnxíng Qí consists of a regular hexagon formed by three 
sets of intersecting parallel lines, for a total of 19 spaces.

Each player has 4 pieces. Player A moves first, followed by Player B. 
The spaces are numbered from 1 to 8. Odd-numbered spaces belong to 
Player A, and even-numbered spaces belong to Player B.

Each player places their 4 pieces in the shaded region on opposite sides 
of the board, as shown in the diagram. These regions are called the
“starting areas.” Player A’s starting area is also Player B’s target 
area, and vice versa.

2. Movement

In each round, both players may make one move, and they must move 
according to the numerical order of the spaces.

That is:

    Player A moves the piece on space 1,
    Player B moves the piece on space 2,
    Player A moves the piece on space 3,
    Player B moves the piece on space 4,
    …
    Player B moves the piece on space 8,
    Player A moves the piece on space 1 again, and so on in this cycle.

If the piece whose turn it is cannot move because all adjacent spaces 
are occupied, the player skips that move and proceeds to the next numbered 
piece. If it still cannot move, the turn passes to the opponent, and 
the cycle continues.

3. Winning Conditions

If one player moves all of their pieces into the opponent’s “starting area,” 
that player wins.

If one player has achieved this condition and the other player can also 
achieve it with their remaining piece(s), the game is a draw.

Sai Pao Qi (Racing Pieces)

Sai Pao Qi is a two-player adversarial game that determines the number 
of moves by throwing dice. The goal of the game is to race one’s pieces 
to the opponent’s side of the board.

Game Procedure

◆ Variant 1

Setup

The board for Sai Pao Qi is shown in Figure 1. There are 100 grid squares. 
Each player has 5 pieces, one side uses black pieces and the other uses white pieces.

Movement

Both players throw dice to determine the number of steps to move, and then 
take turns moving. During movement, pieces may not retreat or move sideways; 
they may only move forward.

Victory Conditions

The player who first moves all of their pieces to the opponent’s side wins. 
If both players reach the opponent’s side at the same time, the game is a draw.

Figure 1: Sai Pao Qi board, variant 1

◆ Variant 2

As the popularity of Sai Pao Qi spread, its rules and board gradually 
underwent certain changes, as shown in Figure 2. Before the match, 
the two players determine who moves first by guessing odds or evens 
(or similar methods). On each turn, a player may choose one piece to 
move, or may choose two pieces, each moving one step. The direction 
of movement is unrestricted, but pieces may not capture opponent pieces. 
The player who first moves all of their pieces to the opponent’s side wins.

Shuangtian Qi (Double-Field Game)

Shuangtian Qi, also known as Defensive Chess, is a two-player adversarial game. 
 
The board of Shuangtian Qi is formed by two “field” (田) shapes rotated 
45 degrees and joined together, hence the name “Double-Field Game”.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Shuangtian Qi board has a total of 17 positions. Each player has 8 pieces, 
distinguished by red/black or black/white pieces. For ease of explanation, 
the positions are numbered: one group is numbered 1–8, and the other group
10–17. Position 9 is empty at the start.

Each player places their pieces on one side of the board along the same
numbered positions, leaving position 9 empty. As shown in the diagram, pieces
numbered 1–8 are placed on the left side of the board, and pieces numbered
10–17 are placed on the right side.

2. Movement

The objective of movement in Shuangtian Qi is to exchange the positions of 
one’s pieces with those of the opponent. The exact positions occupied by 
individual pieces do not matter.

There are two main types of moves:

Step move:
Move a piece to an adjacent empty position.

Jump move:
A piece jumps over an adjacent piece and lands on an empty position beyond it. 
The jumped-over piece remains in place; the color of the jumped piece does 
not matter.

3. Victory Conditions

The two players attempt to exchange their piece positions. A player wins if 
they successfully complete the exchange of positions; otherwise, they lose.

Jian Di Qi is a two-player adversarial game. Its gameplay is similar to 
Tonggu Qi found in Chinese folk board games.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Ya Gu Qi board is based on a 16-square grid, with diagonal connections
added between the squares, for a total of 41 positions. Each player has 
9 pieces, which may be distinguished by color or by shape. The pieces are
placed on the two rows of points closest to each player’s own side of the 
board.

2. Movement

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, a player may move only one 
piece by one step.

3. Capture

If a player’s piece moves to a point adjacent to an opponent’s piece, and 
the two points are connected by a line, then if three pieces lie in a straight
line on the same connection, and the opponent’s piece is in the middle, that
middle piece is captured and removed from the board.

4. Victory Conditions

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins. 
If, after a piece is captured, neither player is able to capture any 
further opponent pieces, the game is considered a draw.

Three-Friends Chess (三友棋)

Three-Friends Chess is a two-player abstract board game. Because its board 
is similar to that of international chess, and because many of its pieces 
use encircling captures rather than direct captures as in Go, it is therefore 
called “Three-Friends Chess.”

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The board for Three-Friends Chess is shown in Figure 1; a standard
international chessboard may also be used.

Each side has 48 pieces, for a total of 96 pieces. Pieces may be placed 
directly on the intersections of the board, as shown in Figure 1.

2. Movement and Capture

Black moves first. Each move consists of moving one piece.

A piece may move one step horizontally or vertically, or diagonally. It may 
pass over pieces that block the way, and may also capture multiple opponent 
pieces in a single move. The movement rules are similar to those of Go.

During movement, if along a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) 
there are pieces of both sides, and the opponent’s pieces lie between two of 
the player’s own pieces, then all those opponent pieces are captured.

If the opponent’s pieces are arranged at the edge of the board in an 
“L” shape, as shown in Figure 2, the opponent’s pieces located at both 
ends are also captured in the same way.

3. Victory Conditions

Three-Friends Chess requires a time limit, generally about half an hour. 
When the specified time expires, the player who has captured more opponent 
pieces wins.

Jiezi Chess is a two-player game played using Chinese-chess (Xiangqi) pieces.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Jiezi Chess board is shown in the figure. It has a diamond shape and 
a total of 30 intersections. There are solid lines, dashed lines, and 
intersections.

Each player has 9 pieces, either red or black. The pieces are:

    5 Soldiers (兵 / 卒)
    2 Rooks (车)
    1 Scholar (士)
    1 General (将 / 帅)

All pieces are placed on the two rows of intersections nearest to the 
player’s own side.

2. Movement

Players alternate turns. Pieces move along the lines, and each move advances

one step only.

3. Capturing

Jiezi Chess uses encircling capture.

If two pieces of the same side are on the same straight line or dashed line, 
and an opponent’s piece lies between them, that opponent piece may be captured.

4. Victory Conditions

The player who captures the opponent’s General (将 / 帅) wins the game.

-------------- Mingyang Tian comments:

Many details are missing in the original text.

I assume it only "borrows" pieces from Xiangqi, so there is no distinguish between 兵/卒, 车 and 士. (将/帅 matters for the goal.)

Crossing-the-Sea Chess (渡海棋)

Crossing-the-Sea Chess is a two-player or three-player board game. The central
part of the Crossing-the-Sea Chess board represents the sea. The two sides set
out from islands or mountains, and crossing the sea to reach the destination is
the objective; hence the name of the game.

Game Procedure

Method of Play I

1. Setup

The board of Crossing-the-Sea Chess is shown in Figure 1. The central area
consists of 9 × 9 = 81 squares, representing the sea. At the top and bottom
there are 3 × 3 = 9 squares each, representing islands. The islands are
generally depicted as eating areas or backward areas. In total there are 
99 squares.

The two sides each have an island, with a sea area between them. The sea area
may contain squares that pieces may not pass through. Some squares also
indicate the direction of movement for pieces entering or leaving the sea area.

Crossing-the-Sea Chess uses 18 pieces in total, with each side having 9 pieces.
During setup, both sides place their pieces on the 9 squares of their
respective islands.

2. Movement

The two sides decide the first player by rolling dice or drawing lots. During
play, a piece moves by stepping from square to square. Each player may move
only one piece per turn, and each move consists of only one step. Pieces may
advance, retreat, or move sideways, but they may not remain stationary or move
backward illegally.

The main types of movement are as follows:

If a piece is blocked by an opponent’s piece and the square behind that piece
is empty, it may jump onto that square. The direction of movement does not
matter. If there are several pieces in a row, and the square behind the last
piece is empty, the jump is allowed. A jump may be made only once per turn and
may not be repeated.

If a piece is blocked by one of the player’s own pieces, regardless of how many
pieces there are or whether there are empty squares, it may not jump over them
to continue moving. If the way is blocked by both an opponent’s piece and the
player’s own piece, movement is also not allowed.

Only when a piece reaches the “bridge” may it move across the sea. After
crossing the bridge, it enters the three squares in the middle of the sea area
and must proceed according to the required direction.

When a piece reaches an island, it must follow the route prescribed by the
rules. It may not jump over other pieces.

Upon reaching the destination, if an opposing piece occupies that square, the
player may place their own piece on top of the opponent’s piece, thereby
capturing it. This is considered a successful crossing of the sea.

3. Victory and Defeat

Whichever side is the first to have all 9 of its pieces reach the destination
island wins.

Method of Play II: Three-Player Game

1. Setup

The board for the three-player version of Crossing-the-Sea Chess is shown in
Figure 2. The central area of the board consists of 81 small squares,
representing the sea. On the left, right, and top sides there is a square area
of 9 squares each, representing mountains. The passages between the mountains
and the sea are the routes for crossing the sea.

There are a total of 27 pieces, divided into three colors, with 9 pieces for
each player. During setup, as shown in Figure 2, the three players place their
pieces on the three sides of the square mountain areas.

2. Movement

The movement rules are the same as those for the two-player version.

3. Victory Conditions

The objective of the game is as follows:

The player on the left must move their pieces to the right-side mountain.
The player on the right must move their pieces to the left-side mountain.
The player at the bottom must move their pieces to the top-side mountain.
The first player to have all of their pieces reach the destination mountain wins.

Pairing Chess (对子棋)

Pairing Chess is a two-player abstract strategy game. It is called 
Pairing Chess because each player places two stones per turn.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Pairing Chess board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 36 cells 
and 49 intersection points.

The two players take turns placing stones. On each turn, a player places two
stones, which may be placed on any empty intersections on the board.
However, the two stones placed in a single turn must be adjacent to each other
and may not be separated.

Stones may be placed either horizontally or vertically.

3. Win/Loss

If a player is unable to continue placing stones according to the rules, 
that player loses.

If both players are unable to place stones according to the rules, 
the game is a draw.

Three-Connection Game (三通棋)

Three-Connection is a two-player abstract connection game played on 
a triangular board. Players take turns placing stones only; there 
is no movement and no capture.

The objective is to form a connected group of stones that touches all three
sides of the board.

Equipment

A triangular board subdivided into a triangular lattice with 64 intersection points.

32 stones for each player, in two different colors.

Setup

The board starts empty.
Players choose a color.
Either player may move first.

Play

Players alternate turns.

On a turn, a player:

  Places one stone of their color on any empty intersection of the board.

Stones, once placed, remain fixed for the rest of the game.

Connectivity is defined by adjacent intersections connected by the edges 
of the triangular grid.

Objective (Winning Condition)

A player wins immediately upon forming a single connected group of their stones
that touches all three sides of the triangular board.

Touching a side means that at least one stone in the connected group lies on
that side of the board.

Draw

If both players simultaneously complete a connection touching all three sides,
the game is a draw.

Notes

This game is a pure connection game, structurally equivalent to Y, 
played on a finite triangular grid.

There is no capture, blocking is indirect, and the game has perfect information.

The game is expected to be drawless under normal play, except for the explicit
simultaneous-completion rule.

King Jump Chess is a two-player abstract strategy game.

Game Procedure

Setup

The board for King Jump Chess is shown in Figure 1. It is a square formed by an
8 × 8 grid, with 64 squares, each square being an intersection point.

There are 32 pieces in total, 16 per player. During setup, each player places
their pieces on the second and third ranks closest to themselves, leaving the
first rank nearest to each player empty, which serves as that player’s home
camp.

Moves and Capturing

The first player is determined by drawing lots. Once decided, players 
alternate turns.

Non-capturing move: A piece may move one step forward or diagonally forward,
but may not move sideways or backward. Only one move per turn is allowed.

Capturing move: A piece may capture by jumping. As shown in Figure 1, when
capturing, there must be an opponent piece directly adjacent in front, and the
jumping piece moves to the square beyond it, which must be empty. The jumped
piece is removed from the board.

A piece that jumps into the opponent’s home camp is promoted to a “King”. 
A King may move one step and may also make multiple consecutive jumps,
capturing several pieces in succession. After each jump, if another capture is
possible, the King must continue jumping. The jumping and capturing rules for
the King are the same as in Checkers.

Special capturing rule:

If one side has two or more adjacent pieces in a straight horizontal line, then
regardless of whether there are empty squares, the opponent may not capture by
jumping along that horizontal line.

However, capturing is allowed along vertical or diagonal directions. 
As shown in Figure 2, the black pieces may capture the white pieces.

Winning Conditions

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins. 
If each side is reduced to only one piece, the game is a draw.

Eight-Character Chess is a board game invented by Zhou Guojian, a villager from
Hunan Province, on the basis of Go (Weiqi), after improvement and innovation.
It is similar in play to Go and represents the inheritance and development of
traditional Go in modern daily life.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The board for Eight-Character Chess is shown in the figure. There are a total
of 16 pieces. Each side has 8 pieces, divided into black and white.

In addition, there are 2 red pieces, which are public shared pieces that both
sides may use. The red pieces are used as substitute pieces.

Each player prepares 5 tokens. During each round, one token may be exchanged
for one piece.

After setup, Black moves first, followed by White. Pieces may be placed freely
on any empty intersection on the board.

2. Movement

After one side places a piece, the opponent must move one of their own pieces.
The piece moves along a line to an adjacent empty intersection; each move
consists of only one step.

During movement, when both players have only one piece remaining on the board,
each player may add two additional pieces, until the game ends.

3. Victory and Defeat

The first player to arrange all of their 8 pieces into a continuous
line—whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal—wins.

(Zhang Xueqin · Wu Ziyao)

---------------------
[a different LLM translation]

Game Process

1. Placement. The Eight-Character Chess board is shown in the figure. 
There are a total of 16 pieces, with each side holding 8 pieces, distinguished
by the colors black and white. Additionally, there are 2 red pieces which serve
as public "wildcard" pieces; both sides may use the red pieces to connect their
line. Each side has 5 reserve pieces; in each round, a reserve piece can
replace a red piece. After the game starts, Black places a piece first,
followed by White. Pieces can be placed on any empty intersection on the board.

2. Movement. The two players take turns moving their own pieces. Move one
square along the lines to an empty position; only one square can be moved at a
time. During the movement process, if both sides have exhausted their reserve
pieces and a winner has not been determined, each side may add 2 more reserve
pieces until a winner is decided.

3. Winning and Losing. The first player to connect their 8 pieces in a
vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line wins.

Capture Chess is a traditional two-player confrontation game. At the beginning 
of the game, the objective is to capture pieces; survival then becomes the
objective, hence the name of the game.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Capture Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of the intersections
of five horizontal and five vertical straight lines, for a total of 25 points.
The board is square in shape.

Each player has 10 pieces. The pieces of the two players are made of different
colors or different materials so that they can be distinguished.

Before the game begins, each player places their 10 pieces on the 10 points
closest to their own side of the board.

2. Movement

Before the game starts, one player holds 1 piece or an empty hand and
challenges the opponent. If the opponent guesses correctly, the opponent 
moves first.

The player who moves first must choose a piece color. Thereafter, the two sides
alternately move their own pieces. Each turn, a player may move only one piece,
and each move consists of one step.

3. Capturing

After one side moves a piece, if that piece encounters an opponent’s piece, it
may jump over that piece and capture it. The captured piece is then removed
from the board, as shown in Figure 2.

4. Victory and Defeat

The game ends when one side’s pieces have all been captured.

Discussion

Capture Chess is similar to Go to a certain extent. Chen Zhiyuan notes in 
A History of the Evolution of Go Rules:

“Capture Chess determines victory and defeat by killing the opponent or by
counting the number of pieces killed. However, as skill levels rise, if one
side only seeks survival, it becomes very difficult to kill them. This can
gradually cause the objective of play to shift from capturing pieces to living.
In that case, living on the board becomes increasingly important. Capture Chess
emphasizes capturing, while living without being captured is also a form of
capturing; thus, capturing and living are two aspects of the same thing. The
transition from focusing on captured pieces to focusing on pieces that cannot
be captured is a natural one in terms of logic. From Capture Chess, with
capturing as the objective, to Go, with living as the objective, the first
stage of Go’s development is thus completed.”

Scoring Go is a two-player confrontation game that combines numbers and
competition and is a variant of Go with a strong competitive character. Both
the board and the pieces may be replaced by those of Go. The main difference is
that the small grid points on the board are marked with scores. Generally,
odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, …) are marked with 1 point, while even-numbered
rows (2, 4, 6, …) are marked with 3 points. ①

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Scoring Go board is shown in the figure. It is a square board formed 
by 8 horizontal lines and 8 vertical lines, producing a grid of intersections.
Each line contains 7 small circles.

Each empty circle is filled with a number—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or
8—representing a score value.

2. Play

Each side has 56 pieces. Players take turns placing one piece at a time,
placing it on an empty small circle.

After a piece is placed, if that piece encloses an area of empty circles, 
the numbers in those enclosed circles are recorded.

If one piece is placed and, at the same time, two numbers are enclosed by 
that player’s pieces, then the two numbers are added together and recorded.

3. Victory and Defeat

When all of one player’s pieces have been placed, the numbers recorded on 
that player’s score sheet are added together. The player with the higher 
total score wins.

Enclosure Chess is a two-player confrontation game and a Go-type board 
game whose main objective is to capture pieces.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Enclosure Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It is a square formed 
by 5 horizontal and 5 vertical straight lines, producing 16 small squares 
and 25 intersections.

There are 24 pieces in total: 12 red and 12 black. The red pieces are shared by
both players and serve as the main pieces, while the black pieces are the
auxiliary pieces.

Before the game begins, the 12 black pieces are first placed on the board as
shown in Figure 1.

2. Play

The two players alternately place red pieces, placing one piece per turn.

3. Capturing

After the two players have placed red pieces alternately, either player 
may use red pieces to surround black pieces and capture them.

After one red piece is placed, if a black piece is completely surrounded 
by red pieces, it is captured and removed.

If, after one red piece is placed, two to four black pieces are surrounded,
then those two to four black pieces are captured simultaneously, as shown 
in Figure 2.

4. Victory and Defeat

After all red pieces have been placed, the player who has captured more 
black pieces wins.

① Chen Hanping. Chinese Folk Chess and Board Games [M]. 
  Beijing: People’s Sports Publishing House, 2007, pp. 239–241.

Variants and Related Games

1.

The Enclosure Chess board may also be a square of 7 horizontal and 7 vertical
lines, producing 36 small squares and 49 intersections. There are 49 pieces 
in total, of which 25 are black and 24 are white.

Before the game begins, both players first place black pieces, as shown in
Figure 3. After setup, the two players alternately place white pieces to
surround black pieces. The player who occupies the last remaining empty
intersection around a black piece captures that black piece.

Typical captures are shown in Figure 4. After all white pieces have been
placed, the player who has captured more black pieces wins.

2.

There is another type of Enclosure Chess, mainly popular in Zhejiang and
Yunnan. It has the same name but different rules.

Each player has 6 pieces, distinguished by color. Before the game begins, 
each player places their pieces on the intersections of three horizontal 
lines on their own side.

The two players begin by competing for the 5 intersections in the center 
of the board. They then contest the remaining 16 intersections. The first
player to completely surround the opponent’s pieces and capture them wins.

Zang Chess, also known as Many-Eye Chess (多眼棋) or Multi-Eye Chess (多目棋), 
is popular in western China and is a Go-type board game.

Zongzang Zhaba notes in A Guide to Tibetan Travel:

“In world chess history, Zang Chess can be said to be ancient and unique.
Whether compared with ‘Tianjiu’ (Six-Piece Chess), ‘Geziluo’ (Cross Chess), or
‘Jiajiajiu’ (Hand-Position Chess), it both absorbs the cultural essence of
other ethnic groups’ chess traditions—simple, ingenious, and interesting—and
also possesses its own distinctive methods and techniques.”

Zang Chess can be played by two, four, or six players simultaneously. In
ancient times it was mainly popular among the aristocracy; today it is commonly
played among the general population, and is especially widespread in Tibet,
Nepal, and Bhutan.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Zang Chess board is shown in the figure. It is generally a 17 × 17 Go board.

Before the game begins, 12 pieces are placed on the board, with 6 black 
and 6 white. These are called the “base pieces” (座子).

2. Movement

White moves first. After both sides have placed the 12 pieces, normal movement
begins. Each move consists of one step.

3. Capturing

When three pieces form a straight line, the player may capture any one of 
the opponent’s pieces.

When one side has only 3 pieces remaining, that side may ignore the one-step
movement restriction and move pieces freely, as long as the player tries to
arrange them into a straight line.

4. Victory and Defeat

The game ends when one side’s pieces have all been captured.

Dark Chess is a chess-type board game played using a Xiangqi (Chinese chess)
board and pieces. Because the pieces are placed face down on the board and are
only revealed when captured, it is called Dark Chess. It is similar to Blind
Dark Chess and to Chinese chess card games.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Dark Chess board is shown in the figure. It consists of a grid formed 
by 5 horizontal and 8 vertical intersecting lines, similar to a Chinese chess
board, for a total of 32 intersections.

All the pieces are placed face down on the intersections. Each side has 
16 pieces. Before the game begins, the pieces are thoroughly shuffled and
randomly placed on the board. The central 2 × 2 area may not contain any pieces.

2. Play

One side is chosen at random to flip over one piece on the board. Once a piece
is revealed, that side takes that piece’s color as their own, and the opponent
takes the other color.

Thereafter, the two players alternately take turns. On each turn, a player may
either flip over one face-down piece or move one of their own pieces.

When moving a piece, except for special rules, all pieces move one step
orthogonally to an adjacent empty intersection or to an intersection occupied
by an opponent’s piece, in order to capture it.

The capture rules for the pieces are as follows:

General (帅) can capture any opposing piece except the Soldier (卒).
Advisor (士) can capture any opposing piece except the General (帅).
Elephant (相) can capture any opposing piece except the General (帅) and Advisor (士).
Chariot (车) can capture any opposing piece except the General (帅), Advisor (士), and Elephant (相).
Horse (马) can move one step orthogonally to an empty square or to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece and may capture any opposing piece.
Cannon (炮) has special rules: it moves orthogonally any number of empty squares; to capture, it must jump over exactly one intervening piece and then land on an opposing piece.
Soldier (卒) may capture any opposing piece.

3. Victory and Defeat

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Bao Yingxiang Chess, also known as Bao Yingxiang or simply Xiang Chess, is
regarded as one of the earliest elephant-type board games in ancient China and
as a forerunner of Chinese chess. Bao Yingxiang Chess has six types of pieces,
collectively called the “Six Armies” (六甲).

Liu Zongyuan, in Eulogies (Songci), wrote:

“The eight directions determine the opening of battle; the Six Armies 
 separate above and below.”

In the Scripture of the Beginning of the Dao (Taishang Jingfa ritual text), 
it is stated:

“With broad deliberation and repeated calculation, one casts and advances the
 Six Armies; generals are arrayed, and chariots and horses belong to their
 ranks.”

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Bao Yingxiang Chess board is shown in the figure. It consists of 
9 horizontal and 9 vertical straight lines, forming an 8 × 8 grid of squares.

During setup, the two sides place their pieces on the first and second ranks.

2. Movement

The first move is made by the Chariot (车).

The chariot moves 2 or 3 squares at a time.

When moving diagonally, it must move to the second rank and capture an 
opposing Soldier (兵) directly in front of it.

The Soldiers advance first; the second rank must leave an empty space so that
the chariot has room to maneuver. Only then does advancing become meaningful.

Historical Notes

Sources and Legends

Regarding historical records of Bao Yingxiang Chess, a passage in the
Tang-dynasty prime minister Li Deyu’s Records of the Strange (Xu Guai Lu)
describes Bao Yingxiang Chess:

“Xu Guai recounts events seen in dreams. In the fifth year of the Tang Zhenyuan
era, a man from Lingnan named Zheng Shun was lodging at the home of a Li family
in Qinzhou. One night he heard the sound of drums. After some time, he dreamed
of drums sounding, with two opposing formations: to the east was the Heavenly
Horse Army, and to the west the Golden Elephant Army. After the formations were
set, a general said: ‘The Heavenly Horse gallops three leagues at an angle;
above it, the generals move horizontally in all four directions, galloping
straight into the eight directions. Only the Six Armies may not move.’

The drums sounded again. Each side advanced one horse by three leagues. The
drums sounded again; each side advanced the chariot horizontally. The drums
sounded again; the armies advanced. After the battle ended, Zheng’s family dug
several zhang into the ground and found an ancient tomb. In the tomb was a
bronze chess set (an elephant game), with pieces arranged in full formation,
all cast in bronze. Only then did they realize that the general’s commands
described the movements of Bao Yingxiang Chess. They burned incense and
flattened the ground, obtained the treasure, and suddenly Zheng awoke from the
dream, crying out. His body recovered, and strange phenomena in the house
ceased.

The above is the full account of Bao Yingxiang Chess as recorded in Records of
the Strange. The author likely used a dream narrative to render ancient chess
movements vivid. Yet it should be noted that the text mentions ‘full 
formations, all cast in bronze,’ which indicates that elephant chess was 
popular among the upper classes after the Tang dynasty, and that its pieces 
were exquisitely made.

Dreams may reflect material reality, but they still differ from it. That people 
in ancient times later saw dream events realized in reality cannot be taken as 
proof; rather, it may be regarded as a coincidence or a moment of insight.”

Dúzǐqí is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its greatest distinguishing
feature is that on a fairly large board there is only a single piece, hence the 
name. The rules are simple, yet the game is full of subtlety. In playing 
Dúzǐqí, although the piece has many possible paths of advance, all routes are 
of equal length—that is, the total number of steps from the starting point to 
the ending point is fixed. Moreover, if on the first move one does not play 
well, this will influence the overall outcome of the entire game. Therefore, in 
every encounter both sides tend to be extremely cautious, carefully calculating 
and comparing possibilities.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The board of Dúzǐqí is as shown in the diagram, formed by straight lines 
intersecting diagonally and vertically. The board contains many squares and 
many intersection points. By agreement of both players, either square-based 
placement or point-based placement may be used.

Point-based placement may also be used. There is only one piece, shared by both 
players; any easily obtained object may serve as the piece—such as a stone, a 
blade of grass, or a twig—though a round piece is preferable. During setup, 
place the single piece on a square at one corner of the board.

(Diagram caption: “Dúzǐqí board”)

2. Movement

The two players take turns moving. On each turn, a player may move one step, or 
may consecutively move two steps. Movement is only allowed forward; moving 
backward is not permitted. If two steps are taken, a turn may be made in the 
middle.

The square where the piece is located at the start of the game is the starting 
point, and the vertex at the opposite corner of the board is the destination.

3. Victory

During play, the position of the piece changes, but there is always only one 
piece. Once the piece reaches the destination, the game ends, and the player 
who moved the piece to the destination is the winner.

Horse-Step Chess is a single-player board game. Its movement is similar 
to the movement of the horse in Chinese chess (Xiangqi), hence the name.

Game Procedure

◆ Method of Play I

1. Setup

The Horse-Step Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It is formed by the 
intersections of 5 horizontal and 6 vertical straight lines, creating a grid.

The player uses one piece, which may be regarded as the “horse” from Chinese 
chess, though it may also be treated as a generic piece. The piece may be 
placed on any intersection, as shown in Figure 1.

2. Movement

The piece must move continuously without repeating any position and must 
traverse all intersections on the board.

Movement follows the horse’s move in Chinese chess: one step straight followed 
by one step diagonally, forming the character “日”.

3. Victory and Defeat

If the player successfully reaches the goal by traversing all intersections, 
the result is a win.

If the piece cannot continue moving, the result is a loss.

◆ Method of Play II

The player takes 49 pieces. At the start of the game, all pieces are placed on 
the board formed by the intersections of 7 horizontal and 7 vertical lines.

The player chooses one piece as the starting piece. Each move follows a 
diagonal direction (as shown in Figure 2). For example, the black piece labeled 
“1” can move to points A or B; the black piece labeled “2” can move to points 
C, D, E, or F.

Each time a piece moves to an intersection, one piece is removed.

If the player removes all pieces, the player wins.
If 40 or more pieces are removed, the result is considered a pass.

Uneven Chess is a two-player abstract game. It takes its name from the uneven 
outline of the board.

Game Procedure

1. Setup

The Uneven Chess board is shown in Figure 1. It uses square intersections; the 
board has seven squares per side, for a total of 49 intersections.

Each player has 7 pieces of a different color. During setup, the players place 
their pieces on the intersections closest to their own side of the board.

2. Movement

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, a player moves one piece. The 
number of steps is not limited, but the piece may only move straight forward.

3. Victory and Defeat

Capturing is not permitted in this game.

The player who is the first to move all of their pieces to the opponent’s side 
of the board wins.

If a player is blocked and unable to move all of their pieces, the opponent 
wins. There are no draws.

Related Game

Mutual-Approach Chess (相遇棋)

The rules of Mutual-Approach Chess are similar to those of Uneven Chess; only 
the board differs.

The Mutual-Approach Chess board is shown in Figure 2. It has a stepped outline 
and contains 52 intersections. Each player has 8 pieces, distinguished as black 
and white.

During play, pieces may move only to adjacent intersections, but the number of 
steps per move is not limited.

The game ends when the final pair of opposing pieces meet; the player whose 
piece reaches the meeting point first wins. There are no draws.

Stack Chess is a two-player abstract game. It is a completely new chess model 
designed according to the ideas of “equal starting positions, free development, 
and non-fixed outcomes.” It uses rules to reflect cooperation and constraints. 
On the surface, pieces are continually captured or removed according to the 
opponent’s rules, but in reality the game emphasizes stacking mechanics and 
presents a very high level of intellectual challenge.

Game Overview

Stack Chess is a two-player game based on a "fair start, free development, but 
different outcomes" philosophy. The core mechanic involves jumping over pieces 
to create "stacks." Once a piece becomes part of a stack, it is locked and 
cannot move again.

Game Process

1. Setup (布子)

    The Board: A grid of 5 horizontal lines and 7 vertical lines, creating 35 
    intersection points (positions).

    The Pieces: There are 35 identical pieces. Unlike traditional chess, pieces 
    are not divided by color to represent sides; they are shared by both 
    players.

    Initial State: At the start, all 35 pieces are placed on the board, filling 
    every intersection.

2. Movement (走子)

Players take turns moving any single piece according to these rules:

    The "Jump Two" Rule: A piece moves vertically or horizontally by jumping 
    over exactly two pieces and landing on the third piece to form a Stack 
    (叠子).

    Direction: Movement must be in a straight line (no diagonals).

    The Jump: The two "jumped" pieces can be single pieces or already-formed 
    stacks.

    Distance: The physical distance is irrelevant. As long as you jump over 
    exactly two occupied positions, the empty spaces between them do not count.

    Stacking Limit: Once a piece has been stacked onto another, it cannot be 
    moved again.

3. Winning and Losing (胜负)

    As the game progresses, single pieces become fewer and stacks become more 
    frequent. Eventually, some pieces become "dead" because they cannot make a 
    valid jump.

    Victory: The game ends when a player cannot make a move according to the 
    "Jump Two" rule. In the standard rules, the player who cannot move loses, 
    and their opponent is declared the winner.
