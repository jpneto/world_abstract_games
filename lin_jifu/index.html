<pre>Bamboo-Basket Game (筜箕棋)

Bamboo-Basket Game is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay 
is similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

1. Setup

The Bamboo-Basket board is shown in Figure 1. It has a total of 19 points
(positions). Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by black and white.
Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty points of the board.
The setup phase ends once all pieces have been placed.

2. Movement

After setup, players take turns moving, one move per turn.

3. Capturing

Captures are made by encirclement.

When a player’s pieces surround an opponent’s piece so that it has no path
to escape, that opponent piece may be captured and removed from the board.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, there are two types of captures: edge capture 
and central capture.

4. Winning

The first player to capture 2 of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Chase-and-Evade Game (追随棋)

1. Setup

The Chase-and-Evade board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 23 square grid points.
The two players use black and white pieces. Black has 11 pieces, and White has 12 pieces, 
which are arranged on the board as shown in the illustration.

2. Removal (Opening action)

After the game begins, Black moves first. Black selects any one of White’s pieces and 
removes it from the board, leaving that point empty.

3. Movement

Players then take turns moving, with Black moving first. A move must follow the grid lines, 
either horizontally or vertically, to an adjacent empty point. Diagonal moves are not 
allowed.

4. Winning

Both players aim to surround the opponent’s pieces. When one player completely surrounds 
the opponent’s pieces so that they have no legal moves, that player wins.

Plum Blossom Chess (梅花棋, Méihuā Qí)

Plum Blossom Chess is a forming-pattern-type confrontational game with 
gameplay similar to Gather Chess (聚会棋, Jùhuì Qí). Both sides take 
turns placing pieces, with the goal being to form the target pattern 
shaped like a plum blossom. The plum blossom patterns are shown in 
Figure 3 and include the following types:

    Upright Small Plum Blossom (正小梅花) - (Top Left)

    Slanted Small Plum Blossom (斜小梅花) - (Top Right)

    Upright Large Plum Blossom (正大梅花) - (Bottom Left)

    Slanted Large Plum Blossom (斜大梅花) - (Bottom Right)

The game ends when there are no empty positions left on the board. 
The side with the highest final score wins. Additionally, when placing 
a plum blossom, one should try to construct the "Double Plum Blossom" 
(双梅花) shape, as shown in Figure 4, which doubles the score.

2. Hexagonal Chess (六角棋, Liùjiǎo Qí)

The gameplay of Hexagonal Chess is also similar to Gather Chess, 
but the board is different. The Hexagonal Chess board and target 
patterns are shown in Figure 5.

Liudaoqi (Six-Path Game)

Liudaoqi, also called Dafangqi, Insert-Dafang, or Swing-Dafang, is played 
in a way similar to Gobang (Five-in-a-Row). It is a two-player abstract 
strategy game that is popular and widely spread among the people.

Game Procedure
1. Setup

The board of Liudaoqi is shown in the diagram: it has 25 intersections 
and a total of 36 playing lines. Each player has 33 pieces, which may be 
round or of other shapes. Players take turns placing pieces on any empty 
intersection except the center point, until the board is completely filled.
Any remaining pieces are kept as reserve pieces.

2. Capturing

During the placement phase, players must place their pieces so as to form 
one of the target patterns. 

If a player forms a target pattern, they capture pieces equal to the 
number specified by that pattern.

If the player forms multiple target patterns at once, they may capture 
a corresponding number of pieces.

After the board is completely filled, players continue capturing according 
to the patterns they form.

If neither player can form a target pattern, they alternately capture 
one piece; this is called “passing” (通子).

The target patterns in Liudaoqi include:

Dragon:
    Six connected horizontal or vertical lines.
    Four of the intersections must be inside the board, and the other two
    must be on the edge.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Six-Slash (also called “Diagonal Slash” or “Through Slash”):
    Six connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Five-Slash (also called “Five-Slash Child”):
    Five connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Four-Slash (also called “Four-Slash Child”):
    Four connected diagonal lines.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Three-Slash (also called “Three-Slash Child”):
    Three connected diagonal lines, with two of the intersections on the 
    board edge.
    Capture 1 piece.

Square (also called “One-Square” or “Large Square”):
    Capture 1 piece.

3. Movement

When no more captures are possible, both players move pieces.
Each move consists of moving one piece by one step only.

During movement, if a player forms one of the above target patterns, they 
capture the opponent’s pieces according to the capture rules and add the 
corresponding number of pieces to their own supply.

If the newly added pieces also form a target pattern, no additional 
capture is made.

4. Victory

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Variants / Related Games (链接)

Liuzhouqi, also called Fangzhou, Anliu, Swing Six, Lailiu, etc., 
uses the same board and pieces as Liudaoqi, but the rules are simpler.
There are only two target patterns:

Chengliu (also called Shangliu or Chengpai):
Six pieces connected in a straight line horizontally or vertically.
Captures 2 pieces.

Chengfang (also called Shangfang):
Four pieces forming a square on the board.
Captures 1 piece.

The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent’s pieces; 
that player is the winner.

<pre>Modianqi (Ink-Dot Game)

Modianqi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is somewhat similar to Bridg-It.

Game Procedure

1. Board

The board of Modianqi consists of 100 ink dots, that is, 100 individual points
arranged in a grid of 10 rows by 10 columns, as shown in the diagram.

2. Connecting Lines

Players take turns drawing a line between any two dots on the board; each turn, 
one line is drawn. Lines may be drawn horizontally or vertically, but not 
diagonally, and no line may be drawn more than once.

The purpose of drawing lines is to enclose four dots to form a square.

3. Victory

Within a square, the boundary edges may consist of lines drawn by either player. 
However, the player who draws the final edge completing the square claims 
ownership of that square.

Additionally, if a line segment between two dots serves as the shared side of 
two adjacent squares, it must still be drawn.

Players may use two different markers to distinguish the squares they have claimed.
The game ends when no more moves are possible; the player who has claimed more 
squares wins.

Wuhuqí (Five-Tiger Game)

Wuhuqí, also known as Five Tigers, Fangcheqi, Dabianqi, Xiabián, Sanxing Sì, 
Wuhuqi, Wumaqi, Changjiangqi, etc., is a two-player abstract strategy game 
widely played in many regions of China.

1. Setup

The Wuhuqí board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 16 squares and 
25 intersections. There are 25 pieces in total: one player has 13 pieces, 
the other 12 pieces. The pieces are distinguished by color. Players take 
turns placing pieces on the board.

2. Scoring and Capturing

Players aim to form specific target patterns.
When a player successfully forms a target pattern, they may capture a 
fixed number of opponent pieces. However, pieces that have already formed 
part of a completed pattern may not be captured again.

Once the board is completely filled, players capture pieces according 
to the patterns they form. If neither player can form a target pattern, 
each player captures one piece.

After this, the first player captures first, then the second player, 
and afterwards players alternate turns.

(Diagram caption: Wuhuqí board)

Target Patterns in Wuhuqí

Five Tigers (also called Five Nests):
    Divided into central tiger and edge tiger.
    Five connected pieces in a horizontal or vertical line.
    Capture 3 pieces.

Tongtian (also called Great Tiger or Large Tiger):
    Five connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 4 pieces.

Small Well (also called Square, Small Square, or Little Well):
    Four pieces forming a square.
    Capture 1 piece.

Three-Slash (also called Small Slash):
    Three connected pieces in a diagonal line.
    Capture 1 piece.

Four-Slash:
    Four connected pieces in a diagonal line.

扎枪扯萝卜 (Zhaqiang Che Luobo)

Zhaqiang Che Luobo is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is 
similar to Nine Men’s Morris.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 25 cells, with 36 intersection 
points. The two players take turns placing their pieces, starting with Black.

2. Forming “Radishes” and “Spears”

When three pieces form a small right-angled shape occupying three vertices of 
a small square, this configuration is called a “radish” (萝卜).

If one player places a piece on the fourth vertex of that small square, the 
piece captures the radish.

After capturing a radish, the capturing player uses their own pieces to occupy 
the three intersections vacated by the opponent.

When three pieces form a straight line, this is called a “spear” (枪架).

If the opponent has one piece on that straight line, it is considered blocked (扎枪).

In this case, the player may capture an entire row of pieces, and then re-place 
pieces at the top of the board.

3. Victory Conditions

When all intersection points on the board are filled, the game ends.
The player who has more pieces on the board wins.

    <li>Goal. When the board is full, the player with more stones wins the game</li>

砖格棋 (Zhuān Gé Qí)

Zhuan Ge Qi is a two-player abstract strategy game. Its gameplay is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It is a large square subdivided internally into 32 small 
rectangles, with a total of 57 intersection points.

Each player has 10 pieces, distinguished by color or shape. Players take turns placing pieces,
starting with Black. Placement continues until all pieces have been placed.

2. Moving Pieces

After all pieces are placed, the two players take turns moving.
On each turn, a player may move one piece by one step.

3. Capturing

When one player’s pieces form a target pattern, that player may capture the opponent’s pieces.

The target patterns in Zhuan Ge Qi include:

the “口” (square) shape
the “十” (cross) shape

If a “口” shape is formed, the player may capture any one of the opponent’s pieces.
If a “十” shape is formed, the player may capture any two of the opponent’s pieces
— one of which must be the piece that just moved.

4. Winning the Game

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins the game.

Er Chi Yi, also known as “Two Capture One”, “Four Squares”, or “Four-Step Top”, 
is a two-player abstract strategy game.

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 16 cells with 25 intersection points.
Each player has 5 pieces. During setup, players take turns placing pieces, and all 
pieces must be placed on the row of intersections closest to the player.

2. Movement

After setup, players take turns moving.
On each turn, a player may move one piece by one step.

3. Capturing

As shown in Figure 2, when one player has two pieces on the same line, and there is 
one opponent piece adjacent on that line, the opponent’s piece may be captured 
(at that moment, there are three pieces on the same line).
This capture is called “top” (顶吃) and is similar to capturing in Tic-Tac-Toe.

However, there are several special configurations in which capturing is not allowed:

If, after moving, the configuration “Two Blacks, One White” appears on the same line, 
the white piece cannot be captured (see Figure 3).

If there is an empty space between the two black pieces and the white piece, the 
white piece cannot be captured (see Figure 4).

If the two black pieces are adjacent to the white piece, the white piece cannot 
be captured (see Figure 5).

If, after a move, although the two black pieces and the white piece are on the 
same line, there is another piece elsewhere on that line, then the white piece 
still cannot be captured (see Figure 6).

4. Winning the Game

The player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces wins.

Related Games

1. 着棋子 (Zhuo Qi Zi)

    Also called Four-in-a-Row, this game has rules identical to Er Chi Yi, differing 
    only in the board.

    The board has 9 cells and 16 intersection points.
    Each player has 4 pieces, distinguished by color or shape.
    Gameplay follows the same movement and capture rules as Er Chi Yi.

2. 推大车 (Tui Da Che)

    Also known as “Pushing the Cart”, this is a two-player abstract game with 
    gameplay similar to Er Chi Yi.

    The board consists of 9 cells with 16 intersection points.
    Each player has 4 pieces, initially placed on the row of intersections closest 
    to the player.

    During play, in addition to “top” captures, if one player’s two pieces form a 
    straight line with two opponent pieces, the player must capture one of their 
    own pieces closest to themselves; this is called “pushing the cart”.

    The winner is the player who first captures all of the opponent’s pieces.

六子冲棋 (Liu Zi Chong Qi)

Liu Zi Chong Qi, also known as Chongqi, Arrow Chess, or Cannon Chess, 
is a two-player abstract strategy game widely played in Sichuan and Hubei.
Each player has six pieces, hence the name “Six-Piece Chong.”

Game Procedure
1. Board Setup

The board is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 9 cells with 16 intersection points.
Each player has 6 pieces, distinguished by black and white.

Players alternately place their pieces as follows:

Four pieces are placed on the four intersections of the bottom row.

Two pieces are placed on the left and right ends of the row just above the bottom row.

2. Movement

Players take turns moving.
Pieces may move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but only one step at a time.
Jumping over other pieces is not allowed.

3. Capturing

Capturing occurs mainly in three situations, as shown in Figure 2.

(1) Two-against-one (二打一)

When three pieces form a straight line, and two adjacent pieces belong to one 
player, while the third end point is empty,
if the other end is occupied by an opponent’s piece, that opponent’s piece 
may be captured.

(2) Two-against-two (二打二)

When four pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging to 
one player, and both ends occupied by opponent pieces,
the player may capture both opponent pieces.

(3) Cannon Capture (挑吃)

If a player inserts one of their pieces between two opponent pieces, and 
one end of the line is empty,
the player may capture the two opponent pieces.

After making a capture, the capturing piece may then move one step horizontally 
or vertically, and may continue capturing using the cannon capture method.

4. Winning the Game

A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces, or by blocking 
the opponent so that none of their pieces can move.

If both players are reduced to one piece each, and neither can capture 
the other, the game is a draw.

Related Game

五道棋 (Wu Dao Qi)

Also called Five-Line Chess.

The board is formed by five vertical and five horizontal straight lines, 
creating 25 intersection points.
Each player has 5 pieces, as shown in Figure 3, placed on the five 
intersections closest to their side.

The rules for movement, capturing, and winning are the same as 
in Liu Zi Chong Qi.

杀蜀黍 (Sha Shu Shu)

Sha Shu Shu is a two-player abstract strategy game that is widely played in the Bazhong–Nanchong–Guang’an region of Sichuan.

Because the pieces placed on the board resemble the drooping heads of 
ripened sorghum (蜀黍) after harvest, the game is also known as Sorghum 
Chess, Harvest Sorghum Chess, or Cutting Sorghum Chess.

In areas where Sha Shu Shu is popular, people often sing the following rhyme:

“I’ll teach you a tune,
 I’ll teach you a little game,
 I’ll teach you the southern Sichuan Sha Shu Shu.”

Game Procedure

1. Board Setup

The board is shown in the diagram. It consists of 25 cells with 36 intersection 
points. Each player has 18 pieces, distinguished by color or shape.

Players place their pieces on the three rows of intersections closest to 
their own side.

2. Movement

Pieces move along diagonal lines only, one step per move.
Moving along straight (horizontal or vertical) lines is not allowed.

3. Capturing

If one of your opponent’s pieces is located on an adjacent intersection 
directly opposite yours along a diagonal, you may capture that piece.

4. Winning the Game

The player who captures all of the opponent’s pieces first wins.

Xiàliù Qí (下六棋)

Xiàliù Qí, also called Xiàliù, is a two-player abstract board game popular 
in the Jiangsu region of China. It developed from ancient Liùbó (Six Bo) 
and is believed to have spread during the Three Kingdoms period, especially 
in the Huai River basin of Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu.

Gameplay

1. Setup

The Xiàliù Qí board is shown in Figure 1 and consists of 36 intersections. 
Each player has 6 pieces. The two players sit opposite each other.

Each player places their 6 pieces on the row of intersections closest to 
them, with one piece occupying each intersection.

2. Movement

The two players take turns alternately. Pieces move either horizontally 
or vertically, and each move is limited to one step. Only one piece may 
be moved per turn.

3. Capturing

Capturing is divided into five main cases:

Minor capture (小吃):
Three pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging to 
one player and the piece at the other end belonging to the opponent. 
The opponent’s piece is captured.

Major capture (大吃):
Four pieces form a straight line, with two adjacent pieces belonging 
to one player and the other two belonging to the opponent. Both opponent 
pieces are captured.

Complete capture (全了):
When six pieces lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, the player 
may freely capture any two opponent pieces.

Advanced capture (夹吃):
If two pieces are on the same horizontal or vertical line and sandwich 
one opponent piece between them, that opponent piece is captured.

Center capture (掏心):
If one piece occupies the center point between two opponent pieces on 
the same horizontal or vertical line, the two opponent pieces are captured.

After a capture, one player continues until no further captures are 
possible, then the turn passes to the opponent.

4. Winning Conditions

A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces or by rendering 
the opponent unable to make any legal move.

If both players are left with one piece each and neither can capture the 
other, the game is a draw.

Linked Variant
Xiàsì Qí (下四棋)

Xiàsì Qí, also called Xiàsì, is a two-player abstract game popular in 
the Jiangsu region.

Its board differs from Xiàliù Qí, as shown in Figure 2. Each player has 
four pieces, placed on the row of intersections closest to them, with 
one piece per intersection.

Movement, capturing, and victory conditions are the same as in Xiàliù Qí.

Huànwèi Qí (换位棋) — “Position-Swapping Game”

Huànwèi Qí is a two-player abstract strategy game. The objective for each 
player is to move all of their own pieces to the starting area of the 
opponent, hence the name “Huànwèi Qí” (“Position-Swapping Game”).

Huànwèi Qí is similar in spirit to Shànxiàn Qí (Single-Line Chess), 
differing mainly in the number of board spaces and pieces. Because of 
this, there are also differences in jumping and capturing, but the basic 
rules are largely the same.

Gameplay
1. Setup

As shown in the diagram, the Huànwèi Qí board consists of a single row 
of 18 small squares.

Each player has 5 pieces, distinguished by black and white. Players place 
their 5 pieces on opposite ends of the board. There must be no empty squares 
between a player’s own pieces.

2. Movement

The player to move is determined by agreement or by lot, and the two 
players then alternate turns.

On each turn, only one piece may be moved, and it may only move forward, 
never backward.

If a piece encounters an opponent’s piece and there is an empty square 
immediately beyond it, the moving piece may jump over the opponent’s piece 
and land on the empty square. No matter how many opponent pieces lie in 
between, they may all be jumped over, but jumps may not be chained 
consecutively.

A player may not jump over their own pieces. If a player’s own piece is 
blocking the way ahead, the player must wait until the blocking piece 
moves before pieces behind it may advance.

3. Winning Conditions

The first player to move all 5 of their pieces to the opposite end of 
the board wins.

<br><b>Rules</b>:
<ul>
    <li>Material. Each player has 5 stones.</li>
    <li>Setup. Each army is placed on the extreme five squares of the 1x18 board.</li>
    <li>Gameplay. The player moves a friendly stone forward to the adjacent empty square, or jumps a sequence of adversary stones landing on the immediate next empty square. Jumps are not multiple.</li>
    <li>Goal. The player that moves all of this pieces to the extreme five squares wins the game.</li>
</ul>

As with most traversal games, an extra rule is necessary to prevent drawish strategies. Something like: if the five extreme squares are all occupied while the player already has none of his at the first five squares, then that player wins the game.
