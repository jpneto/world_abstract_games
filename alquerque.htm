	<p align="justify"><i>Draughts is a very ancient game indeed, the origins of which, like Chess, aren't completely clear. However, early
forms of Alquerque, its venerable ancestor,
have been found in Egypt dating at least as
early as 600BC. Alquerque boards can be seen carved
into the stone slabs which form the roof of the great temple
at Kurna, Egypt, which was built in 1400BC (of course, they
might have been carved at any point since). The game of Alquerque
was played like Draughts on a 5 x 5 point board with the
pieces starting in a non-symmetrical pattern. The game clearly had
staying power - it is mentioned under the name of Quirkat in the
Arabic work Kitab-al Aghani, the author of which died in 976 AD.
Quirkat was first brought to Europe by the Moors during their
invasion of Spain. It was recorded as Alquerque (Spanish form
of El-Quirkat) in the Alfonso X Manuscript which was written
between 1251 - 1282 at the command of Alfonso X, King of
Leon and Castile.</i><font size="2"> [From

forward, either straight or diagonally. They may capture (jump) only diagonally 
forwards (like in Checkers). Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces.

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Zamma (Damma, 
Srand, Dhamet) is played on a quadruple Alquerque pattern (Arabic Alquerque is 
the forefather of checkers). The Zamma board is quite old. It is believed to be 
the precursor of the Alquerque board pattern. A Zamma board survives among the 
roof-slab scribings at Kurna (c. 1400 BCE). However, the present version of 
Zamma is believed to rely heavily on developments in draughts since the 17th 
century (a supposition that could be challenged). It is still played in North 
Africa, where the black pieces are called men, and the white pieces are called 
women. When played in the Sahara, the men are represented by short sticks, 
whilst the women are pieces of camel dung. Black makes the first move. <br><br>This game is called Srand (or Dhamet) in Mauritania, where it is the national 
game. In the particular variant played the captured counters are removed 
instantly from the board. In other variants the removal of captured pieces is 
deferred. <br><br>Pieces are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. They can only move in the 
forward directions, however, they can make multiple captures, by the short leap, 
in any direction. Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Note that one 
must always choose the line with the most captures. Pieces are promoted to 
Mullahs (also called Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a 
capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does 
not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can 
move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land 
anywhere behind the captured piece. In one variant it cannot jump repeatedly 
over an enemy piece, in another variant it can (that is, the captured piece has 
already been removed). Capture is compulsory. <br><br>A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an 
enemy piece and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it 
and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a 
single turn.<br><br>By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging 
one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage 
generally leads to a win. Mullahs are very powerful, and one can sacrifice 
pieces to achieve promotion. Remember that men standing on the diagonal matrix 
have greater scope. <br><br>This is an intriguing checkers variant. The counters have different scope 
depending on which squares they are positioned. On half of the squares they can 
capture in eight directions, in the other half they can capture in four 
directions and move in only one. The board pattern allows this freedom of 
capture directions while half of the diagonals are removed, compared with a 
checkers board. Possibly this game carries some advantages compared with 
international draughts, which has become very drawish in grandmaster quarters.

	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Kharbaga belongs to the Zamma 
	family. It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that 
	is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque 
	pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the 
	number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very 
	attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of 
	squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a 
	complex game.<br>

	It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, 
	and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types 
	of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on 
	the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters 
	are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the 
	most captures.<br>
	<br>
	A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied

<p><a name="fetach"></a><font face="Arial"><b>Fetach</b> (Quireq) is a Moroccan variant. According to the 
Ludii <a href="https://ludii.games/details.php?keyword=Fetach">website</a>: <i>5x5 intersecting lines with diagonals drawn in each 
quadrant. Twelve pieces per player, which begin on the rows closest to the 
player and the two spots to the right of the central point, leaving the central 
point open. Players alternate turns moving the pieces along the lines of the 
board. The first play is from one of the pieces directly above or below the 
central point. Pieces cannot move backwards. A player may capture an opponent's 
piece by hopping over it to an empty spot immediately adjacent to the opponent's 
piece on the opposite side, along the lines of the board. Pieces which reach the 
opposite edge of the board from where they started are promoted and can move and 
capture any distance along the two large diagonals of the board. The player who 
captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.</i></font></p>
<p><a name="politics"></a><font face="Arial">A modern game inspired by Alquerque is
<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153635/politics">Politics</a>, a 
game from 1893:</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="icons/Politics.jpg" width="229" height="232"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The game description at BGG: <i>The two players have 
different colored pieces. There are three sizes of game piece; each player has 
two statesmen (large,) four politicians (medium,) and six voters (small,) for a 
total of twelve, referred to as that player's phalanx.<br>
<br>
The game begins with players taking turns placing any one of their pieces on any 
one station. Like Mill, when a player is able to line up three of his pieces in 
a row, he is then entitled to remove one of his opponent's pieces, but in the 
case of this game, only voters may be removed in this fashion. Unlike Mill, 
pieces in Politics may jump and capture each other as in Checkers, in any 
direction, once the initial placement phase is concluded. A piece may only jump 
a like-sized or smaller piece. To win, one must reduce the opponent to only two 
pieces, or to immobilize his remaining pieces.</i></font></p>
