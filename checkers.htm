CHECKERS FAMILY</font></strong></h1>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Traditional</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">According to R.C.Bell, the original
game was invented around A.D. 1100 somewhere in the south of France. The game
was inspired on an older Arabic game, <a href="alquerque.htm">Alquerque</a>, and the first name of Fierges.
Later the game was called Dame where there was no compulsion to capture. This
rule was only introduced on 1535 also in France. English draughts is the game of
Dame. Notice that Checkers is not a single game, but a family of games. Here are
a part of that big international family.</font></i></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Checkers/Draughts are very widely played 
around the world. 
The regional variants are conceptually the same, but they differ in some details 
(that change the strategic and tactical planning). There are the following 
common ideas:</font></p>
<table border="0" width="80%" id="table4">
	<tr>
		<td width="100%">
		<ul>
			<li><b><font face="Arial">PIECES</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;</b> - 
			There are two pieces, called here soldiers and Kings. The game 
			starts only with soldiers.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b>TURN</b> - On each turn, each player moves 
			one friendly piece. Piece may move into an empty cell or capture one 
			or more enemy pieces.</font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial">Move - soldiers move to adjacent diagonal 
			empty cells, Kings have more move range.</font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial">Soldiers promote to Kings when moving into 
			the last row.</font></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Capture - pieces capture enemy pieces by 
			jumping over them and landing on an empty cell within the same line.</font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial">There are <i>short jumps</i> (the piece must 
			land on the immediate next cell which must be empty) and <i>long 
			jumps</i> (the piece may move one or more empty cells on a straight 
			line before and/or after the jump).</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Captures are mandatory, i.e., they have 
			precedence over moves. Captures are multiple, a piece must continue 
			capturing while there are captures available. A capturing piece may 
			never jump twice over the same enemy piece, and the captured stones 
			are only removed when the capturing sequence ends. Some variants 
			demand that the sequence must (a) <i>max-piece</i> 
			- maximize the number of captures, or (b) <i>max-stone</i> - 
			maximize the number of stones (Kings have two stones).</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">If a capture sequence of a soldier passes 
			thru the last row, the usual options are: </font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial"><i>stop</i> - the soldier stops moving and 
			gets promoted; </font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><i>skip</i> - the soldier continues the 
			capture sequence and does not get promoted; </font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><i>adapts</i> - the soldier continues the capture sequence and 
			does get promoted</font></li>
			</ul></li>
			</ul></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b>GOAL</b> - Wins the player that stalemates 
			the opponent. This is
          possible either by: (a) capturing all opponent's stones; or (b) 
			blocking the remaining enemy pieces.</font><ul>
				<li><font face="Arial">If neither player can accomplish this, the
              game is a draw.</font></li>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><a name="kens0"></a>A similar game is <b>Kens</b> (I
don't know the author) which uses the same setup. Soldiers move to an adjacent
orthogonal empty cell (but not backwards) and may also jump (not backwards) over
adjacent friendly stones landing on the immediate empty cell. If the soldier
jumps over an enemy it captures it (it's valid to jump backwards when
capturing). Capturing jumps are multiple and it's mandatory to maximize the
number of captures after the player selects which piece he is going to move (in
case of existing several stones able to capture). When a soldier reaches the
last row it's transformed into a King. Kings may slide any number of empty cells
in a straight (orthogonal) line or jump over adjacent friendly stones and then
slide any number of empty cells. Kings also capture like soldiers. After a
slide, they can jump over an enemy piece and then slide again. They obey the
same capture rules (mandatory and max-capture after choosing the piece). Wins
the player that stalemates the opponent (which includes capturing all enemy
pieces).<br>

========

Sempre facendo riferimento al libro &quot;Il Manuale dei Giochi&quot;, ecco qui un bel
nuovo gioco, variante della dama:


Questa variante semplificata della &quot;damma&quot; richiede una scacchiera di 5x5
caselle e 12 pedine per giocatore. La pedina puo' spostarsi in tutti i sensi di
un passo alla volta, si mangia nella maniera usuale della dama, in tutte le
direzioni, la presa e' obbligatoria e il soffio e' ammesso. La pedina che
arriva a dama (nell'ultima fila) puo' spostarsi in linea retta in tutte le
direzioni e senza limitazioni di percorso.

Nor(X) - Men(O)     Men(O) - Nor(X)

O O O O O           O O O O O
O O O O O           O O O O O
O O - X X           O . o X X
X X X X X           X X X X X
X X X X X           X X X X X

Ho proposto la versione senza coordinate. L'ultima mossa e' minuscola, il punto
di partenza della mia pedina e' un &quot;.&quot;, mentre le normali caselle vuote sono
dei &quot;-&quot;.


La partita di destra inizia gia' con una bella sequela di obbligati...


Ciao!      Pitch   //

the game is played on an enlarged board where the extra external cells can only be

the rule found in some of V.R. Parton's Checkers variants, such as Kinger and
Dragon, that some pieces may only land on edge squares if that is the only way
to make a capture. The King's orthogonal capture was inspired by Frisian or

<font face="Arial"><a name="hide"></a><b>Hide</b>, is a 8x8 checkers variant, where each player
starts with 8 stones each, placed on the first 2 rows. Stones cannot capture nor
jump, but an isolated stone is removed from game. Wins the player that makes the
last move.&nbsp;Ralf Gering suggests a 8x12 board (8 rows, 12 columns). It seems
that there is a simple solution to this game. Gering's words: <i>Black, the
second player, must always imitate the last move of White in a symmetrical
fashion. This ensures that Black is moving last and wins.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">In <b> Board Draughts</b>, each player also starts with 8
stones of the first two rows. Stones cannot capture and
just move and jump forward. The goal is to move all stones to the last row
(where they are removed from board). Wins the player with no stones left.&nbsp;I
don't have information about if jumping is mandatory, but I would guess that it
is. Ralf Gering noticed that an extra rule is needed for blocked positions (a 
player would be unable to jump), which would be a win for the blocked&nbsp; 
player. This rule adds extra tactical depth to the game, as shown in this 
position sent by Ralf:</font></p>
