          first turn, both players switch two or more stones to achieve an
          asymmetric board position (symmetric tactics can achieve an easy draw
          for the second player).</font>

				<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Moves one of his stacks on any
              orthogonal direction, exactly the same of cells as its size,

                  upper part of the stack (that sub-stack moves the number of

                  stones are removed, while friendly stones go to the player's

					<li><font size="3" face="Arial">If the cell is occupied, the
                  stone is placed on the top (any excess over 5 stones is also

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">An hexagonal variant of Focus is 
<a href="https://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/525-crossfire">Crossfire</a>
with the following extra rule: [author words] &quot;<i>the capacity of a cell
equals the <u>number of adjacent cells</u>!&quot; Corners will hold at most a
stack of two, sides at most three or five, and cells of the inner area at most
six. This gives rise to a strategy not possible in Focus: moving big stacks onto
'low-capacity' cells, corners in particular. Thus considerable numbers of
prisoners can be made and reserves created on fixed target cells. In Focus for
instance one can never make prisoners, nor create reserves, by moving a stack
onto a vacant square. In Crossfire, moving a stack of five onto a vacant corner
renders three men.</i></font></p>
