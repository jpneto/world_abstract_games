     <p>The list includes several categories:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>book/article - relevant books (focusing on multiple games) and articles in this field</li>
       <li>event - venues, contests, institutions, cultural moments regarding abstract games</li>
       <li>games - a selection of good or relevant abstract games</li>
       <li>ludeme - year of introduction of relevant game rule concepts</li>
       <li>publisher - either very big game companies, or small companies very focused on abstract games</li>
       <li>software - advances or important moments in board game programming</li>
       <li>website - online resources</li>
     </ul>
     <p>of course, every 'the first' sentence is open to change if new evidence appears</p>
