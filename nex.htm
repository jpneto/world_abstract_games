    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The use of neutral stones greatly increases 
	the game complexity with a small increase in rule complexity. The tactical 
	possibilities are larger since neutral stones are both a benefit and a 
	problem shared by both players.<br>
	<br>
	Whatever the options of White and Black, the number of black and white 
	stones will always be equal at the end of each turn. The number of neutral 
	stones, however, can change and be reduced even to zero.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Nex games are full of tactical subtleties. An 
	interesting feature is that there are no useless stones on board; it is 
	always possible to recycle them to swap a pair of neutral stones.<br>
	<br>
	When the number of neutral stones rises, the game reaches a critical mass 
	that produces swap battles that may decide the winner. Forcing moves (i.e., 
	making the adversary to play at a specific point) are the easiest way of 
	preventing the adversary from swapping important neutral stones on his next 
	turn.<br>
	<br>
	It is common the co-existence of two plans: one with friendly pieces and 
	another based on neutral structures that mines the adversary groups and may 
	provide an alternative path to victory.<br>
	<br>
	In the extreme (and rare) case where the board is almost full, we apply the 
	following conventions:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial">When there is only one empty hexagon and 
		there are no neutral stones, the player just drops a friendly stone.</font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial">When there is only one neutral stone and 
		no empty hexagons, the player converts the remaining neutral into a 
		friendly stone.</font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial">When there is one neutral and one empty 
		hexagon, the player drops a friendly stone on the empty hexagon and the 
		opponent converts the neutral stone.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><font face="Arial">After each one of this moves, the game will surely 
	end.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial">These conventions are required to completely define 
	Nex and any other game where this mutator is applied. Actually, games like 
	Gomoku, Y and Gonnect can be transformed into very nice variants with this 
	concept.</font></p>
