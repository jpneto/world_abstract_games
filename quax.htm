<a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/rec.games.abstract/c/O5cJCE-l1EA">post</a> 
in r.g.a at Dec 18, 1992, using another name: <b>Link</b>.</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">This game, LINK, is very similar to 
	TWIXT, mentioned here several times.<br>
	I imagine it is more slow-moving than twixt, however.<br>
	<br>
	It is a game I invented some while ago, though never played. Doubtless it 
	has<br>
	been independently invented many times. It is an attempt to create a game<br>
	close to the connection game, HEX, but played on an orthogonal board. It is<br>
	essentially the same as hex, but to ensure a result, (no ties), there is a<br>
	twixt-like move available, whereby one may connect two diagonally adjacent<br>
	cells of one's own color, instead of a regular placement move.<br>
	<br>
	I have never played it, as I say; but if anyone is interested in trying an<br>
	email game, I would be very keen.<br>
	<br>
	Naturally, rule 1, board size, is open to negotiation; and I would suggest<br>
	a three-move equalization (described here earlier) would be suitable<br>
	to counteract the obvious first-move advantage.<br>
	<br>
	RULES OF LINK<br>
	=============<br>
	1. It is played on an orthogonal 8x8 board, by two players, black &amp; white.<br>
	<br>
	2. Black has first turn. At each turn a player may EITHER put a counter of 
	his<br>
	own color in any vacant square; OR connect two diagonally adjacent counters<br>
	of his own color with a bar of his own color, PROVIDED that such a bar does<br>
	not cross over one of the opposite color.<br>
	<br>
	3. The winner is the first player to complete a path of stones between his<br>
	own two edges of the board: north-south for black, east-west for white.<br>
	A path is a sequence of stones each of which is either orthogonally<br>
	adjacent to its predecessor or connected to it by a bar.<br>
	=============<br>
	<br>
	. O X .&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the rules are suitably unambiguous, and not too 
	long-winded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be clear there is an 
	unlimited supply of counters and bars<br>
	X X O .&nbsp;&nbsp; available. A bar may not be placed if either end is 
	vacant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; \ \ <br>
	. O X O&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagram here shows a completed game on a 4x4 board. 
	Black has a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won with a 4-counter 
	2-bar path. Black has played 7 moves and white 6.<br>
	. O X .</font></p>

	<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There's a reimplementation of Quax, from 
	2004, called <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/57814/stymie">
	Stymie</a> by Randall Bart. </font></p>
	<p align="center">
	<img border="0" src="icons/stymie_eg.png" width="500" height="500"></p>
	<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The main difference is a more complicated 
	rule about how many moves each player can make. In fact, so complicated that 
	I don't understand the wording (or the logic). So, let me just copy-paste it 
	from <a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/stymie.html">
	http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/stymie.html</a>:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Courier New">Two players, Vert and Horz, take turns 
		placing pieces of their colour on the board. Vert plays first and places 
		a single V piece on any empty cell as the opening move.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Courier New">Thereafter players may place either:<br>
		1) One piece of their colour on any empty cell, or<br>
		2) Two pieces of the colour on an empty octagon and an adjacent empty 
		square.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Courier New">If the opponent's last move was a singleton 
		(not counting the opening move) then the current player may instead make 
		a special three-piece move, occupying an empty octagon and two empty 
		squares adjacent to the octagon or an empty square and two empty 
		octagons adjacent to the square.</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial">Bill also considered a variant where two friendly 
	stones become diagonally adjacent, the corresponding connection is made 
	immediately (except if the opposite cross-diagonal already exists). This 
	variant is called <b>Quickway</b>.</font></p>
