    <div>Mark Steere, you are mentally disturbed.<br><br>><br>> Now you've done it.  You've awakened the sleeping commandant.  This<br>> guy actually runs around in the snow totally naked except for knee<br>> high leather boots, whipping his own butt with a riding crop, just to<br>> give you an idea.  Hard to imagine, I know, but well documented on<br>> various S&M forums.<br>> <br>> He's also the only member ever to be banned from SDG.  I can't prove<br>> that though.  He was so vile that all evidence of his presence there<br>> had to be cremated, and the ashes transported to a hazardous waste<br>> dump in Skull Valley, Utah.<br>></div>
