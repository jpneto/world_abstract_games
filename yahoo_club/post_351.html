    <div>Hello Claude,<br><br>are you French? <br><br>Actually it's a wonderful way to learn Czech, to translate all these <br>games. There are only six games left now and my car is still broken, <br>so I have plenty of time this weekend at my home. I don't have TV or <br>internet at home, just a radio and a pet duck. <br><br>Today I translated Cislovane kameny ("number stones") a Russian game <br>from the early 1980s (probably "kameni nomeri" in Russian). I think <br>equally strong pieces are also permitted to capture each other. It is <br>quite a remarkable game.<br><br>"Male Go" btw appears to be Czech for Gomoku.  Many games are not <br>very good, but some are true jewels.  <br><br>Did you try Ball's Chess, Kavkaz Dama (i.e. Chechen Draughts), <br>African Draughts or the Medieval Battlefield?<br><br>truthforum</div>
