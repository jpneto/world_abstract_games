    <div>I disagree.  Yes, tossing a coin and randomly arranging pieces are<br>both random events that take place before either player has taken a<br>turn.  But the difference is that the coin toss only determines who<br>plays White or moves first and is otherwise totally independent of the<br>game.  The random arrangement of pieces on the other hand is part of<br>the game. Chess 960 specifies how the pieces are arranged with kings<br>being in the middle and other pieces being equal and opposite but<br>otherwise random, etc. <br><br>In the case of Chess 960 because players have equal and opposite<br>arrangements of pieces there's probably not a huge variability of move<br>order advantage among positions.  But, imagine a variant of Chess 960<br>in which each player has his own random initial arrangement, not<br>necessarily equal to his opponent's initial setup.  Or you could take<br>it one step further and give each player a random number of queens. <br>You'd have a virtually guaranteed win if you got three queens and your<br>opponent didn't get any.<br><br>Luck doesn't belong in abstract games.  It exists in Chess 960.  I'm<br>not buying this argument that if a game only has a little bit of luck,<br>it can qualify as an abstract game.<br><br><br>> <br>> I would say that Chess960 is an abstract game, because both players<br>> have perfect information when they make their moves. They decide at<br>> random which of the 960 setups to use, but this is prior to the actual<br>> gameplay and no more of a problem than deciding at random which of<br>> them is to play White. The same setup is used for both players, and<br>> while some setups might accent or diminish White's advantage (or,<br>> conceivably, reverse it), it's not essential that an abstract game be<br>> well-balanced -- merely desirable.<br>> <br><br><br>=</div>
