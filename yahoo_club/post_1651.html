    <div>I've printed out the rules for Cage and will try it out when I get a chance.  Off the cuff I can say that the centering mechanism is a very interesting one.  I've tried something  similar to it before in some of my own games but was unable to get it to work well.  I've also tried a cornering mechanism (inevitable movement towards a single corner as the means of convergence) but couldn't get that to work well either. <br><br>Steve<br><br><br> <br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
