    <div>Not only am I an avid board game fan, but I am<br>also a light weight backpacker. I decided one day to<br>merge the two hobbies onto a single sheet of paper.<br>This brings me to you fellow Board Gamers. I'm trying<br>to fit as many board games onto one sheet of 11<br>1/2"X 8" piece of paper. Here are the criteria.<br>The<br>board has to be simple enough to be drawn in the dirt<br>or made by laying twigs out.<br>The game pieces have<br>to simple enough to improvise with different colored<br>rocks or buttons or coins... etc.<br>The rules have to<br>be very simple.<br>Some examples of games I've<br>already included are DAO, Abalone, and The Game of Susan.<br>If you haven't played these games before I suggest<br>you try them out. You'll understand why I would<br>include them. Well, if you have any suggestions please<br>throw them at me. Even if I can't include them on my<br>sheet of paper, I'll at least try them out. Please<br>either post your suggestions here or send them to me at<br>eb_ab@... <br><br>Well, Thanx for your help.<br>Wayne</div>
