    <div>The Way Of Go (TWOG)<br><br>Equipment:<br>Board:<br>N by N (perhaps 13 by 13) (toidal?)<br>Pieces:<br>(N^2)/2 for each player (more than<br>enough)<br>		white/black.<br><br>Object: To capture enough opponent pieces to fulfill your<br>contract.<br>Contract: Contract is determined by your skill level When<br>you consistently win, your contract is increased by<br>one stone. And vice versa. A beginner's contract is<br>one stone.<br><br>Play: The players' turn alternate.<br><br>Pie rule: The first player places the first three<br>stones, which would be two white stones and a black<br>stone. After that the second player chooses whether to<br>play black or white. After that, it is the black<br>stone's player's turn and turn alternate<br>hereafter.<br>	<br>Turn: A turn consists of an optional move and <br> a<br>required placement.<br><br>move: A piece can move exactly<br>as far as<br> the number of liberties the group<br><br>that the piece belongs to have.<br><br>capture: If<br>your piece lands on an<br>	 opponent's piece after<br>a<br>	 move, the opponent's piece<br>	 is<br>captured.<br><br>placement: Pieces can be placed on any space <br>	 that is<br>empty. <br><br>Commentary: <br><br>As you all probably<br>noticed, it is nearly impossible to change the range of a<br>piece to anything below two, except for very well<br>constructed traps which forces a piece to move into a trap<br>that instantly takes away all its<br>liberties.<br><br>Making the board toidal would remove any edge<br>effect.<br><br>An 8x8 game would be very tactical and short, though<br>still very interesting. The game will unlikely to be<br>longer than 20 moves for 1 stone contracts. In any case,<br>I would definitely like to submit it for the<br>contest at abstract game magazine, but unfortunately I<br>have not subscribed it yet, so if you be so kind to<br>send me some instructions on how to submit the game<br>for the contest. It will be very<br>appreciated.<br><br>I'll try to implement these rules in ZRF ASAP and test<br>somethings out. Though zillions might not play it too<br>well.<br><br>Thanks everyone.</div>
