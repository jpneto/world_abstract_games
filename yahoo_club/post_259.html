    <div>Hi Steve,<br><br>I think the kind of games you invent are en vogue now. There are lots <br>of Territorial Games and Connection Games recently such as Cats & <br>Dogs, Clobber, Scarab, Blokus, Wong's Game and Alta. Alta is now a <br>Zillions game and was invented by Dan Troyka, another member of this <br>forum. However I prefer to play it on a board larger than "standard", <br>which can be done easily.<br><br>BTW I have a few questions / remarks concerning the rules:<br><br>> TRELLIS (standard version)<br><br>After playing it several times today, I like it more than ever. I <br>like the simplicity of its rules. Indeed, Trellis belongs to the <br>great games of humanity, it is a wonderful connection game. Others I <br>enjoy are:<br><br>Twixt, Polygon ("Hex"), Octagons, Havannah, Gomullo, Connexxions (by <br>Tom McNamara), Trax, Game of Y, Poly-Y, Star, *Star, Alta, and now <br>Trellis :-)<br>I don't like Connection Games which have no perfect information such <br>as Lightning, Kaliko or Tantrix. <br><br> <br>> ORBIT (standard version)<br><br>> 7.  A "half-orbit" is a connected group which, together with one <br>side <br>> of the board, completely encircles one or more points of the board.<br><br>Only "one" edge? <br>So this isn't a half-orbit: (?)<br><br>......<br>xx....<br>.x....<br><br><-- lower left corner<br><br><br>> 9.  It's possible for there to be shared territory (points where <br>both <br>> players are prohibited from playing).<br><br>Could you give an example?<br><br>It appears that neither Ko fights nor invasions of opponent's <br>territories are possible.<br><br><br>Gamely yours,<br><br>TruthForum2001</div>
