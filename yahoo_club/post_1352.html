    <div>It reminds me a bit of Teeko or Mills (9 Men Morris)<br><br>I found this:<br>http://64.233.167.104/search?q=3Dcache:5lu9AXB83YgJ:www.iupui.edu/~geni/documents/Games_Asia.doc+Nerenchi+rules&hl=3Den&ct=3Dclnk&cd=3D1&gl=3Dus<br><br>Three-In-A-Row Game of Asia<br><br>Nerenchi is an ancient three-in-a-row game played in the Asian country<br>of Sri Lanka. Children all over the world play three-in-a-row games<br>for two players. Tic-tac-toe is an example of such a game. The object<br>of the game is to get three markers in a row on some sort of diagram<br>that is used as the game board. In =E2=80=9Cnerenchi=E2=80=9D the row can be made<br>along the side of a square, along a line joining the midpoints of the<br>sides of the squares, or along the diagonal line joining the corners.<br>These are games of strategy.  =E2=80=9CPlacing=E2=80=9D: Players take turns placing<br>one counter at a time on an empty point on the board. This part of the<br>game ends when 22 counters are on the board, leaving 2 empty points.<br>Making =E2=80=9Cnerenchi=E2=80=9D during this stage earns a player an extra turn. <br>=E2=80=9CMoving=E2=80=9D:  The last player to place a counter on the board moves<br>first. The players take turns moving one counter at a time along a<br>line to the next point. You may not move along the diagonal lines or<br>jump over counters. Making a nerenchi during the moving stage allows a<br>player to remove one of the opponent=E2=80=99s counters from the board. <br>Loser:  The player that has lost all but two counters or is blocked<br>from moving loses the game.</div>
