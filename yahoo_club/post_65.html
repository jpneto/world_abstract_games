    <div>Though I don't have enough experience in Go to<br>judge but it seems to me another interesting variant,<br>taking these idea a step forward would be to add to the<br>usual stones a fix number of stones of life. which<br>course can be captured like normal stones. But also have<br>the additional property of giving life to any group<br>within its reach, that is there exist a path that does<br>not cross any of the opponent's territory between the<br>stone of life and your group. Stones of life in this<br>variant would be two sided so that when captured becomes<br>a stone of life for the opponent. For a 19x19<br>board, I would say 4 stones of life per player at the<br>start of the game.</div>
