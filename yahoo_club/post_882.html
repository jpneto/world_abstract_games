    <div>> I suddenly notice you could create yet another<br>> interesting variant by taking the reverse of what<br>> Markthomps said. In other words, say that the player<br>> can move anywhere he wants, as in Orthodox Pente, but<br>> the five-in-a-row that creates a win must be arranged<br>> along Knight moves. In other words, if you had stones<br>> on a1, b3, c5, d7, e9, that would be a win.<br><br>That sounds like a good idea.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
