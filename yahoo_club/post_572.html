    <div>> I read somewhere that there are 200+ mancalas<br>> but most of them are very similar (am I wrong?)<br>> with just very little rules changes. I wonder<br>> how many "really different" mancala variants<br>> are there? (I'm trying to buy a good mancala<br>> book, but they are unavailable at Amazon...)<br><br>I didn't buy a copy when I saw it in the local bookstore a few years<br>ago, but _Complete_Mancala_Games_Book_ (ISBN 1569246831) looked very<br>promising. Also, while it's more of a general games book than an<br>authoritative text, _The_New_Games_Treasury_ (ISBN 1576300587) has a<br>small, but well-chosen selection of mancala games that showcases some<br>of the differences among them.<br><br>> I'm making a webpage "The Mancala Family"<br>> [....] You (and everybody else :^) can check<br>> it at the provisory link:<br>> http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/_T_mancala.htm<br><br>I'll definitely check it out. Thanks, Joao!<br><br>Clark</div>
