    <div>> This French game which is called "Conspirateurs" (invented at the <br>end <br>> of the 18th century) is played on a board which has 17x17 <br>> intersections. It has a special area 5x8 intersections in the <br>center <br>> (8 wide), the "meeting place".<br><br>Thanks for the corrections. <br><br>Just one point, the meeting place has an area of 5x9, right?<br><br>Joao</div>
