    <div>With GRYB-Go, stones may be entered onto the field on any open node. <br>The player would be tempted to place on positions which offer the <br>most liberties.<br><br>With "Time Vectors" Chess, the field would be divided into four <br>separate 4x4x4 areas.  Each 4x4x4 area would occuppy one corner of <br>the overall field.  The players would initially occupy 4x4x4 areas <br>which are diagonally opposite.  These could be easily identified <br>merely by the orientation toward the individual player, but some form <br>of color indicator could be applied, such as a bit of tape.  <br>The "capture-only" and "move-only" 4x4x4 areas would be in relation <br>to each of the players.<br><br>Please do not take umbrage to the use of the term "Time Vectors" when <br>referring to this form of Chess.  Like I've stated before, I have not <br>settled on an actual title for this game.  I would be interested in <br>any suggestions.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@y..., "David Barnhart" <davidb@j...> wrote:<br>> Thank you,<br>> <br>> I would like to hear more.
