    <div>If you were looking for public physical venues open to people playing abstract strategy games at them, then check this directory out here:<br>http://Venues.IAGOClubhouse.com<br><br>We also could use more. We are looking at what should be over 100 venues in all 50 states in the United States. We would like to get more into this directory, for not just the United States, but also the rest of the world.<br><br>On the page is a link to a guide to finding physical venues, if you need help finding one not in the directory currently.  Please contact me through the abstractgamers.org forum if you have more.  On the Clubhouse website is also an email address.<br><br>There may be a question as to why this list is needed.  As per a guide to finding venues:  In the "ecosystem" of games, an essential part is physical venues to meet at. These venues serve for a way to meet new people in a safer environment, rather than the homes of individuals. Expanding and recruiting players is a challenge without having places like this to meet. Advertising and promotion of meetings is challenging also, and homes will often face space restrictions. Because of this, public venues are essential to the "ecosystem" of game players.<br><br>- Rich</div>
