With all due respect I'm sure there are countless articles<br>> written by innumerable authors describing the influence of Go on<br>> society - all written by people who have spent so much time playing<br>> and studying Go that the game has assumed an exalted status for them,<br>> playing an imaginary, influential role in society.<br>> > 'Go!

Nothing More Than a Game."<br>> <br>> The title of this thread hints at the delusion.  "[Go is] one of the<br>> most abstract games in the world."  Go is no more or less abstract<br>> than thousands of other abstract games "in the world."<br><br>Mark, in all due respect, I will disagree with you.  Playing abstract<br>strategy games have been known to improve cognitive skills.  Study<br>strategy, either in books, or on a board, gives one a broader<br>perspective.  Go also has been featured in multiple movies, and uses<br>as metaphors, as is the same with chess.  The movie Pi had featured Go<br>in it.</div>
