    <div>Some mistakes in "New Rules for Classic Games" (R. W. Schmittberger,<br>1992):<br><br>1.<br>Page 24-25: <br>"Indeed, it can be demonstrated mathematically that in games with<br>unequal forces and unequal objectives, it is impossible to create a<br>perfect balance between the players, unless a draw is the correct<br>outcome."<br><br>Quite strange formulation!<br>What is a "*perfect* balance", IF not a draw?<br>The "correct outcome" of ANY two-players game (not just those with<br>unequal forces and unequal objectives) is, if the game is played<br>perfectly, either a win for the first player, a win for the second<br>player or a draw. <br> <br><br>2.<br>Page 88:<br>(Concerning Halma) "While the original rules did not make this<br>explicit, a player should not be allowed to block the opponent's<br>victory by leaving one or more pieces in his home area indefinitely.<br>Thus, it is necessary to add a rule that a player wins any time, other<br>than at the very start of the game, when the starting area diagonally<br>across from his own starting area is full of pieces, regardless of who<br>owns those pieces."<br><br>Trivial draws are still possible. This is a non-solution.<br><br><br>3.<br>Page 90:<br>(Concerning Salta) "White must try to get his number 1 piece to the<br>square where Black's number piece 1 started, and vice versa."<br><br>Wrong object! See:<br>http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/salta.html<br><br><br><br>4.<br>Page 133:<br>"Sprouts. This paper-and-pencil game, invented in 1960 ..."<br><br>It was invented in 1967. See:<br>http://www.geocities.com/chessdp/rules.htm<br><br><br>5.<br>Page 173:<br>"A player must choose the move that captures the most pieces possible,<br>without regard to whether the captured pieces are men or kings".<br><br>It would be nice if Schmittberger would use the official rules of the <br>Spanish Checkers Federation which state:<br> <br>"Rule of Quality: If having two branches of capture, with the same<br>number of pieces each, it is compulsory to capture those of highest<br>quality, i. e. kings are the choice against men." <br>See:<br>http://www.ctv.es/USERS/jlgsanz/checkers/rules.html<br><br><br>6. <br>Page 174:<br>"The board ... (although traditionally, board squares are all of one<br>color.)<br><br>Perhaps this was true a hundred years ago. Today, Turks are using<br>checkered boards. I've played Turkish Draughts in Turkish Cultural<br>Associations.<br><br>"A man reaching the last rank by means of a jump immediately becomes a<br>king AND continues to jump as a king as part of the same turn if<br>able."<br><br>The Turkish Checkers Online Club of Koksal Karakus doesn't know this<br>rule, but simply states:<br><br>"Piece Promotion: A piece reaching the far row of the board gets<br>promoted to a king (=dam in Turkish), and the move terminates." <br><br>http://www.geocities.com/karakusk/dama/rules.html<br><br><br>7.<br>Page 184:<br>(Concerning Hexdame) "If a player has no legal move, the game ends in<br>a draw."<br><br>I asked Christian Freeling who invented Hexdame: "Was this ever true?"<br>He responded: "No, never. If a player can't move, he has lost (as in<br>International Checkers)."<br><br><br>My comment:<br><br>It would be good to correct Schmittberger's exaggerated reputation he<br>has as a game expert. He makes lots of mistakes.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
