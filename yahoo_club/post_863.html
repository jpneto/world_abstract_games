    <div>Hi Martin,<br><br>> What does the group think about the game-logic in the game Unlur ?<br>> Does it helps with the first-move advance ?<br><br>Yes I think the contract phase of Unlur helps address any inherent <br>first move advantage. The board positions that develop during the <br>contract are complex enough that I believe it would be extremely <br>difficult for either player to consistently force an advantage game <br>after game.<br><br>However, my limited experience with Unlur makes me wonder if the <br>contract mechanism is *too* powerful. It seems that the decision to <br>call the contract is overwhelmingly critical and in most cases <br>decides the game; playing the rest of the game out becomes something <br>of a denouement. This seems to be exacerbated by the game's unequal <br>goals.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, I think it's a most interesting game!<br><br>In terms of first move advantage, Chameleon appears to be well <br>balanced. Chameleon is played as per Hex, except that players may <br>choose to play a piece of either colour per turn, and players win by <br>connecting their edges with a chain of either colour. Any move that <br>is good for the player is also potentially good for the opponent, <br>hence first move advantage is diminished.<br><br>Cameron<br><br>PS. Better check for typos so I don't get scolded again :)</div>
