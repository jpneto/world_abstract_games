    <div>Last week I invented a new abstract-strategy stacking game called Pylon.<br>It uses Icehouse pyramids and a 5x6 board.  It's heavily influenced by<br>Dvonn, but I think it's different enough that it wouldn't be<br>considered plagiarism.  I'm not an expert on abstract-strategy game<br>design, but I think it works fairly well.  Let me know what you think.<br><br>http://steak.place.org/games/pylon/<br><br>--dougo@...</div>
