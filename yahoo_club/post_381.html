I've been playing solitaire games of Y on the base-11 <br>board, which works extremely well, though I haven't figured out how <br>to notate it.  (Surely there's some easy method?) To anyone who <br>hasn't tried it, I can't recommend curved Y highly enough.<br><br>http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/the_game_of_y.html Has an <br>example of Y notation on the curved grid.<br><br><br>> There's actually no racing element in quadrant Hex.<br><br>Yes, you're right of course, sorry; I didn't express myself very<br>well. What I meant to say is, the game can reduce to four quadrant <br>contests, and as long as one side can win three of those, the whole <br>board battle does not matter. Consider Quadrant Hex on an 8x8 grid.<br>To play this well, a knowledge of 4x4 opening theory would help,<br>and 4x4 is completely analyzed at<br>http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~queenbee/openings.html<br><br>Since the following argument refers to the above link, I follow the<br>convention used there: A1 is an acute corner, first player border<br>rows are 1 and 4. I extend this to 8x8 QH.<br><br>Any initial move on the short diagonal wins in 4x4, and anything<br>else loses (disregarding swap). Suppose the first move in an 8x8 QH<br>game (with swap) is D1, which is on the short diagonal for that <br>quadrant. The 2nd player can now lose the game by not swapping and <br>playing C5, for example. Why? Because C5 corresponds to C1 in that <br>quadrant, an initial move which does not win. Now the 1st player can <br>respond with B7, which defeats C5 in that quadrant. At this point,<br>the first player has a win in two quadrants, and the other two are<br>blank. Player 1 can guarantee a win in one of those two blank<br>quadrants by playing symmetrically in those two quadrants; in<br>other words, if player 2 moves in one of those quadrants, player 1<br>can make the identical move in the other. This strategy will give<br>player 1 the win. I hope this makes sense.<br><br>In more general terms, if one player can ever secure a win in two<br>quadrants, and the win in the other two quadrants goes to whoever<br>moves first in each, then a win is assured without worrying about<br>the full board battle. So, it seems Quadrant Hex would tend<br>to be simpler and less interesting than plain Hex on the same size<br>grid. But it could still be interesting, I suppose...</div>
