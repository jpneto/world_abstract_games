    <div>> I've always thought that backgammon, yes, even though it uses dice, <br>is a<br>> borderline case on being considered a true abstract strategy game.  <br>Please<br>> note that many backgammon positions do indeed satisfy your above<br>> requirement.<br><br>I hope I'm not coming across as too stuffy about the definition, <br>though I think it's backed by a lot of usage by people who wanted to <br>be very clear about which games they were talking about. Actually, I <br>have a website called "Abstract Games," <br>(http://www.flash.net/~markthom/index.html) and among the games <br>described there are a couple of backgammon variants. Though I do have <br>a disclaimer on the links saying they aren't "true abstract <br>games" ...</div>
