    <div>Try Grindtorp. :-)<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-<br>bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/34369?do=show;id=1010<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "milomilo122" <nbentley@w...> <br>wrote:<br>> I am an entrepreneur, developing a new method for marketing games, <br>> which will likely be feasible only for abstract strategy games <br>(this <br>> irony is not lost on me.  I know how these fair commercially).  I <br>am <br>> in the initial stages of identifying (so as to eventually acquire <br>the <br>> rights to) a game or games to bring to market, and for this I need <br>> advice from experts.  I seek games that are worthy of the same <br>level <br>> of study, competition, and culture as are now enjoyed by Chess and <br>> Go.  I am hoping that some of you can provide me with a small list <br>of <br>> games that you feel meet the above criterion, and where possible, <br>> information regarding how to contact their authors.  Please do not <br>> base your choices on how marketable games are.  Rather, base your <br>> choices on how close to perfection games come.  In fact, the game <br>or <br>> games that I will eventually settle on are likely to be <br>unmarketable <br>> from the normal perspective (i.e. deep, difficult to understand <br>> without study).  Additionally, if you know of other experts who <br>might <br>> be willing to share their opinions, I would be grateful if you <br>could <br>> forward this message to them.  Responses can be e-mailed to me at <br>> nbentley@w...        <br>> <br>> Some desirable game features to consider:<br>> <br>> 1)      Not public domain, or, if it is public domain, open to   <br>> improvement(s) on which to base a proprietary version.<br>> 2)      Complete information <br>> 3)      For two players<br>> 4)      Resistant to programming, and for which the memorization of <br>> openings is not likely to be a dominant factor.<br>> 5)      Balanced, or at least balance-able (by a pie-cutting <br>> mechanism, etc.)<br>> 6)      Ideally, it should have either a small draw ratio or a zero <br>> draw ratio.  <br>> 7)      As deep as possible.  By deep I mean: if millions of people <br>> played the game, how many different levels of skill would they <br>> exhibit?  I realize this is a difficult question to answer, but<br>> it's <br>> a crucial one, so please focus on it if you can.  The game should <br>> reveal its secrets only slowly, with great study. <br>> <br>> The following is a list of a few initial candidates that appear (in <br>> my inexperienced view) to be the sort of games I'm looking for. <br>> Feel <br>> free to comment.<br>> <br>> 1)   Onyx<br>> 2)   Havannah<br>> 3)   Realm<br>> 4)   Gipf<br>> 5)   Octi (probably a large variant)<br>> 6)   Medusa<br>> 7)   Dominions<br>> <br>> Thanks for your time,<br>> Nick Bentley</div>
