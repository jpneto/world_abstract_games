    <div>Pylos is the castrated version of Strat-o-Sphere. I know the inventor (David <br>G. Royffe) from the Gamer's Fair in Essen He is  a nice guy. Pylos is meant <br>for people with no or very few intellectual capacities (this is basically <br>what Gigamic told me in an interview) who are glad when a game is over as if <br>it were something disgusting like a school lesson or torture. The original <br>game is played on a much larger board and has an interesting point-scoring.<br><br>>Mark Steere writes:<br>>  > Does anyone know if draws can occur in Pylos?  Only one ball can claim<br>>  > the top spot, but what if nobody reaches the top?<br><br>According to Dave's rules (not the spoiled ones by Gigamic),  the player who <br>could move last is declared the winner.<br><br>>it appears that you can place a marble that forms a square and then<br>>immediately remove the same marble, i.e. pass.  Even if you disallow<br>>this, you might form a square and remove a marble from a second<br>>square, and then re-form the second square and remove a marble from the<br>>first square, etc.  So it does seem that a trivial cycle is possible.<br><br>This wouldn't happen, as your opponent would block the square by putting a <br>stone on top of it. As you need four stones to make a square, but your <br>opponent only one stone to stop it, this strategy wouldn't work. BTW, in the <br>original rules, the last player to move wins (whether this is a circle or <br>not).<br><br>Ralf</div>
