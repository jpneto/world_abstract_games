    <div>Hi<br><br>> Three Crowns appears to be a nice game. It was first described in <br>the <br>> Abstract Games magazine and is also included in Joao's fantastic <br>> collection of abstract games. There is, however, a small mistake in <br>> Joao's description: Three Crowns was invented by Larry Back who (I <br>> bet) has still the copyright (L Lynn Smith has only implemented the <br>> game for Zillions). So Joao should change that before he gets <br>> problems with Larry's lawyer.<br><br>You are 100% right! It was my mistake when I was editing the page.<br><br>Lynn already mentioned it to me and I corrected it already!<br><br>Thanks anyway!<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
