    <div>As some of you may recall, I released a game called Rush in May of<br>2007.  I had offered the exclusive right to program Rush to one<br>particular game site, the owner of which accepted my offer and<br>promised to implement Rush at her earliest convenience.  Now after<br>nine months of extended delays, the owner of said game site has<br>reneged on her promise.  <br><br>I've now rescinded said game site's exclusive right to program Rush<br>and I hereby release Rush into the public domain.  <br><br>What a huge waste of time that was.  The owner of said game site had<br>originally asked me to make my future games exclusive to her site.  I<br>volunteered to make exactly one game, the next game that I would<br>design, exclusive to her game site in reciprocation for her promise to<br>program all of my existing games, which promise was also reneged on.</div>
