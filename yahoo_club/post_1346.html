    <div>It's very easy to proof that you supported criminal behavior.

You told<br><br>people in your underscore group that I was supporting illegal<br><br>activities (if unable to be justified, you possibly could be sued for<br><br>libel, by the way for saying this). And you called for your boycott<br><br>pretty much. This was because I didn't side with you to stage a<br><br>crusade against Mark to keep him out of IAGO and blacklist him. Why<br><br>else did you kick me out of your underscore stacking group? You did,<br><br>and posted a message. Why Ralf, unless you want IAGO to fail, because<br><br>Mark has some association with it?<br><br><br><br>> I find it odd that games should be removed for personal reasons<br><br>> whether they were designed by me or Steere.<br><br><br><br>When people say they "refuse to support IAGO" or tell people to avoid<br><br>it, what conclusion do I reach about their games? You have just said<br><br>you don't want any of your games in any IAGO tournaments, thus, it<br><br>sounds like you don't want them anywhere near IAGO. Feel free to see<br><br>the master list and how many games are on there. I don't need any<br><br>headaches in having to remove and put back anything there. So, you<br><br>say you don't want IAGO supported, then IAGO will remove anything of<br><br>yours that might support it. They are your games after all.<br><br><br><br>> I'm writing a book about good mancala games, and Steere's Diffusion is<br><br>> one of those included. It doesn't matter that I dislike Steere -<br><br>> however he behaves it doesn't change or affect his game in any way.<br><br><br><br>That is your choice. Apparently how Mark behaves, and your view of it<br><br>does impact ME and IAGO somehow. Otherwise, the mystery of why you<br><br>boot me out of the underscore stacking group remains.<br><br><br><br>> "I know IAGO could benefit from more Mancala variants."<br><br>> I agree.<br><br><br><br>Yes they could, but they won't be by someone who has kicked me out of<br><br>their group, and is pretty much hostile towards IAGO. If you care to<br><br>explain your hostility, besides some oddball, "You support illegal<br><br>activity", then we can get your games in. But, as of now, all I see<br><br>you as, is someone who is hostile towards IAGO and wants it to fail.<br><br>With this mentality, I don't see why your games would belong anywhere<br><br>near IAGO or in its knowledge bases. Ralf, why would you want your<br><br>games anywhere near IAGO if you disagree with it, and pretty much hate<br><br>it?<br><br><br><br>Anyhow, I have a dozen of other more important things than trying to<br><br>beg with you and even figure you out. If Chess and other abstract<br><br>strategy games were on TV, and in the place poker was now (minus the<br><br>laws against it being played), then I would have far less to do. But,<br><br>as of now, I don't have that luxury. My time is far better spent<br><br>trying to figure out how to get players to China for the World Mind<br><br>Sport Games, than hunting down any of your Mancala games and getting<br><br>them in the Master List actually (this is complete with the off-chance<br><br>risk someone might find it and want to do an IAGO World Tour event<br><br>with it).<br><br><br><br>Well, I will leave it with you. If you don't care that games are in<br><br>IAGO, and would rather IAGO not have your games show up in any of<br><br>their tournaments, they won't be on the Master List. But, you have a<br><br>different view, I can get them in there, and also even list your book<br><br>in the resources when it is done. But, this is up to you. As for me,<br><br>I have more important things to do.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
