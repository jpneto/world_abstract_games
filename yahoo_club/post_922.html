    <div>Hi,<br><br>I just came across the following puzzle from Karl Sims' excellent <br>puzzle collection at http://www.genarts.com/karl/puzzles.html:<br><br>Fair Cake: When two people want to share a cake fairly, one cuts, <br>and the other chooses. Assuming this is a fair scheme, devise a <br>similar scheme for 3 people and 1 cake. Nobody should get short <br>caked even if the other 2 cooperate. <br><br>Answer: A cuts off a piece. B has the option to reduce that piece <br>and take it, and then C has the same option. The remainder of the <br>cake is split between the other 2 people with the usual "one cuts <br>and the other chooses". <br><br>Alternate recursive method: Starting with approximate thirds, each <br>person can swap with either of the other 2 but then must give at <br>least a crumb back to whoever he swaps with. This cycles until <br>nobody wants to swap anymore. <br><br>I'm wondering whether this might suggest an optimal swap rule for <br>three-player games with a first (and possibly second) move <br>advantage? Is there currently a generally accepted swap rule for <br>multiplayer games?<br><br>Cameron<br>=</div>
