    <div>Just speculating here: I think a beautiful move would be a totally<br>non-obvious expert move, even catching your expert opponent off guard.  And<br>it would strongly alter the balance of power in the game, perhaps<br>guaranteeing, or nearly so, your victory.  What George W. Bush might refer<br>to as "strategery."<br><br>Mark<br><br><br>On 9/14/06, Ralf <peace_panther@...> wrote:<br>><br>>    Chess masters talk about beautiful moves in Chess, a Renju master has<br>> written an article about a beautiful Renju move for Abstract Games<br>> magazine.
