    <div>While waking up this morning these rules came to me.  I am curious if<br>this game exists or not.  It needs a name.  As of now, it is called<br>"The Single Line Game".  I recall there is supposed to be a 1D Go type<br>game.  Maybe this is like it.  Anyhow, the rules:<br><br>[Single Line game]<br><br>Set up (X and O represent two different sides of pieces.  Board can be<br>larger or smaller in size):<br>X X X X X X X X X X<br>: : : : : : : : : :<br>+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+<br>: : : : : : : : : :<br>O O O O O O O O O O <br><br>Object: <br>Occupy the most spaces at end of game. Keep playing until one player<br>no longer has a legal move.  Then count up who has most pieces in the<br>middle (the + area).  Player with most spaces in middle of board<br>occupied with their pieces wins the game.<br><br><br>Play:<br>1. Slide one of your own pieces into the middle of the board to an<br>unoccupied space if you can (the + represents this in diagram above).<br><br><br>2. Capture rules:<br>A. Bookend capture. If a piece slides and bookends a line of pieces of<br>an opponent, all the opponent's pieces are removed:<br>O-X-X-X-O<br>^<br>: Piece slides in here, resulting in:<br><br>O-+-+-+-O<br><br>In bookend capture, the board is considered to wrap around.  If a<br>player can bookend a group of pieces that wraps around the board, then<br>it can capture.  Example:<br><br>O-O-O-O-+-+-+-+-X-O<br>        ^<br>        : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces, resulting in:<br>+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-X-+<br><br>Same with this:<br>O-O-O-O-+-+-+-+-+-X<br>        ^<br>        : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces, resulting in:<br>+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-+-X<br><br>If positions were reverses with which X piece slid in, it still wuld<br>be the same:<br>O-O-O-O-X-+-+-+-+-O<br>                ^<br>                : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces,<br>resulting in:<br>+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-X-+<br><br>AND<br><br>O-O-O-O-X-+-+-+-+-+<br>                  ^<br>                  : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces,<br>resulting in:<br>+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-+-X<br><br> <br><br>B. Majority capture. If a piece slides in and creates a group larger<br>than an opponent's group of pieces, the pieces of opponent are removed:<br>O-O-O-X-X<br>^<br>: Piece slides in here, resulting in:<br>O-O-O-+-+<br><br>In majority capture, the board is not considered to wrap around, like<br>with bookend capture.<br><br>A piece is not legally permitted to slide in between two opponent's<br>pieces if it would result in it being bookend captured, unless the<br>slide results in a capture of an opponent's piece:<br>Not legal to enter: O-+-O<br>Legal to enter: O-+-O-X- (Entry looks like: O-X-O-X, resulting in:<br>O-X-+-X)<br>Legal to Enter: O-+-X-O- (Entry looks like: O-X-X-O, resulting in:<br>-+-X-X-+-)<br><br><br>Variant rule:<br>Rather than capture, flip pieces to own side, like in Reversi/Othello.</div>
