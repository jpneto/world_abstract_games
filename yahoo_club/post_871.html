    <div>Hello,<br><br>I did a little bit of research in Byte, the new stacking game invented <br>by Mark Steere. The results were quite unexpected. I analysed endgames <br>of eight stones and small boards. The results will help to win endgames <br>fairly easily and are also useful in the opening and middle game.<br><br>The results will be published in the new group<br><br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/true-stacking-games/<br><br>Come and join us,<br><br>Ralph</div>
