    <div>This new book written by Cameron Browne is absolutely a must for <br>anybody interested in abstract strategy games. 402 pages are <br>providing complete rules for over 200 connection games and variants <br>including several games of territory in which connections play an <br>important role (e.g. Go, Tanbo, Anchor, Orbit, Blokus). It is, <br>indeed, a "comprehensive study of the connection game genre", <br>although a few connection games are not included, such as the three-<br>dimensional game of "Blox" (Daniel LaLiberte, 1994) "Gomullo" (Roland <br>Johansson, 1999), which has the object to make the shortest <br>orthogonal connection between two opposite board edges that is <br>possible (ie a row), and "Connections" (Tom McNamara, 1972), a <br>variant of Bridg-It (not the same game as erroneously stated on page <br>160), but much deeper and, in fact, one of the most successful <br>connection games ever marketed. On the other hand the book describes <br>many games I didn't know and it will probably take me years until I <br>tried all of them.<br><br>A very good book!<br><br>Ralf Gering<br><br>  <br><br>http://www.hypernews.org/HyperNews/get/Blox.html<br>http://othello.dk/book/index.php?title=Gomullo<br>http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~joe/connections/<br>http://www.abstractstrategy.com/connections.html<br>http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/txt/C/Connecti.html<br>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3370<br><br><br>Cameron Browne.
