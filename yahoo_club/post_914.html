    <div>> Kavkaz Checkers. <br>> <br>> Two players (White and Black) have armies of 24 checkers, arranged <br>in<br>> all the cells on the first 3 rows of an 8x8 board. White moves <br>first.<br><br>Well, I usually play on a larger board: 33 pieces on a 13x13 board, <br>if you play only on the dark squares (scroll down the Czech site). <br>The Chechenian board resembles a little bit the Mauretanian Srand <br>board.<br><br>Mark, any idea how the board for 43 stones may look like?<br><br><br>> A checker may move without capturing to any of the three<br>> forward-adjacent squares (diagonal or orthogonal).<br>> <br>> A checker may capture in any of the eight directions by means of the<br>> short jump (jumping over an immediately adjacent enemy checker, to a<br>> vacant square just beyond it). Multiple captures are allowed. <br>> <br>> Capturing is obligatory, and a player must choose a move that <br>captures<br>> the largest possible number of enemy checkers.<br>> <br>> There is no promotion. Checkers reaching the last row can still<br>> capture or be captured, but cannot move otherwise.<br>> <br>> A player loses when it is his turn and he has no legal move. It<br>> follows that draws are impossible.<br>> <br>> <br>> This strikes me as a "standard" checkers variant, the one novel<br>> feature (certainly a significant one) being the lack of promotion.<br><br>And the lack of draws.<br><br>70% in international Draughts at World Championships<br>92% in English Draughts / American Straight Checker<br><br>There are not many Draughts variants with no draws:<br><br>Gorgon, Impasse, Desertion.<br><br>Perhaps a few more.<br><br>I changed the rules of Sleeping Beauty a little bit:<br><br>Now games can end in "no result" and must then be replayed with <br>reversed colors (as in Shogi).<br><br>Ralph<br>=</div>
