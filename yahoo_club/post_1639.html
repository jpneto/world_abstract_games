    <div>Fractal is a variant of Hex.<br><br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/pictures/Fractal.jpg<br><br>In Hex, the center cells are valued much more highly than those in the outlying areas. Fractal attempts to compensate for this disparity by shrinking the center area cells and expanding the outer area cells, and by shearing the sharp points off Hex's rhombus.<br><br>The design goal in Fractal was a more level playing field, a more equitable game.  Fractal presents a finely scaled array of values for first moves.  Player 1 can select a move much closer to zero in value than he can in Hex, severely weakening Player 2's pie rule advantage.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com<br><br><br>=</div>
