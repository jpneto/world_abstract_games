    <div>I started a Twixt message board over at Gamers.com:<br><br>http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=twixter<br><br>I hope the above URL works for the general public. When I<br>use it on my computer, I am automatically logged in as twixter.<br>I'm not 100% sure that other users will go right to my<br>message board, or if they will be asked to log in as<br>twixter. If anyone has difficulty with the above link,<br>please let me know.<br><br>No one has posted there yet, except me. I'm hoping it will<br>eventually be used to post challenges for online play,<br>and to hold any kind of discussion about the game.<br><br>Online Twixt is now possible, BTW. If you have the software<br>package "Zillions of Games" you can download Twixt from their<br>website at http://www.zillionsofgames.com<br>Look for Twixt listed with the July 6 game releases.<br>My website has some screenshots and info at<br>http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/ZTwixt1.html<br><br>If you'd rather not pay for Zillions, there is a free Java<br>applet that actually PLAYS the game, albeit poorly, at<br>http://www.twixt.de<br>If you have the Java Runtime Environment (also free), you<br>can download their jar file and run it on your machine.<br>It's entirely in German. The 'pie' rule is NOT supported,<br>nor is link removal. It appears to have Internet<br>connection capability. If you'd like to play a German Java<br>Net Twixt game sometime, I'm willing to try it out with you!<br><br>David "they call me Mister Twixt" Bush</div>
