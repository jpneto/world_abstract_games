    <div>> after some time of playtesting I feel comfortable now with my new game<br>> "Abande" I'm proudly introducing here. It's quite original and - as<br>> always - there are some twists you will notice only when you're actually<br>> playing it. If you are interested and you have some spare time visit<br>><br><br>Hi,<br>  Would it be okay with you if we implement the game on the Play-By-Email Server<br>http://gamerz.net/ ?<br><br>Regards<br>Martin</div>
