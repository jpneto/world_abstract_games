Anyhow, the IAR is flawed, and not the best<br>measure.  As part of the acceptance process, it is the LAST part of<br>the process and meant to handle gray areas.  At this point, it should<br>hardly be used by anyone.  It is a tool, mainly now to tell people<br>how, and by how much they are deviating from what makes up 2 player<br>only combinatorial game theory games.  This then tells people what<br>they need to adjust in order to become a better fit for IAGO with<br>their game.  In this fashion, it works ok.  But it fails as the only<br>test of whether something is in IAGO or not (aka, if it is 3 or less,<br>it is an IAGO Abstract Strategy Game).<br><br>There have been several cases that exposed as not being sufficient,<br>with these being the most notable examples of breakage points with the<br>IAR being the only filter:<br>1. Rock-Paper-Scissors, under the IAR alone (because reference to game<br>equipment was removed, based upon feedback of others), came up a 3,<br>and thus was in IAGO.  And this seems not right at all, eventhough RPS<br>has ended up on ESPN and having IAGO next to it would get IAGO exposure.<br>2. Someone wanted to use the IAR to come up with an acceptable word<br>game in IAGO (to "create a new genre of abstract strategy games"). <br>The end result here is IAGO ends up starting to cover all table games<br>or mindsports. This end result is IAGO loses its meaning.<br>3. Someone kept arguing over and over for Mate, a deterministic card<br>game being in IAGO.  If you go with equipment, it is out.  If you<br>don't, then RPS is in.  Again it is a mess.<br><br>Well, I did then go with what Mark said of you need an approval board<br>for all IAGO related games, and it will be somewhat subjective, but<br>also tightened up the acceptance process and its documents.  Also, the<br>IAGO World Tour ends up being the main way for saying in or out.  Thus<br>far, no regular Backgammon has gotten in, although a deterministic<br>Backgammon is in.</div>
