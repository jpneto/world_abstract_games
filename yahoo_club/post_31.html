    <div>Thanks, Joao for the excelent suggestions! I<br>think I have a simple solution that will make it<br>possible to eliminate my restrictions and maitain certain<br>things the rules confer.<br><br>I wanted the early stage<br>of the game be mainly isolated stone framing the<br>game and that the opponents stay close to each other<br>and not abuse the move. This lead to the restrictions<br>that I have. Now that I know what to do they seem like<br>fiddly rules now.<br><br>The solution: remove all the<br>restrictions and change the rule on movement to read. A piece<br>can move exactly as many spaces as there are empty<br>spaces (liberties) othogonally around that piece. (A<br>possible variant would make it even more Go like by<br>stating number of spaces a piece can go is exactly the<br>same as number of liberties the group that the piece<br>belongs in have.) So by changing from mobilization to<br>immobilization all the problems vanish.<br><br>As for the pie<br>rule, I am not quite sure, but three move equalization<br>sound sufficient.<br><br>Last undetermined thing is<br>board size. What do all of you think is a good size.</div>
