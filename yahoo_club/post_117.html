    <div>Hello Joao,<br><br>I completed a beta this<br>weekend of Epaminondas, which may be a useful starting<br>point for Skalus or Kefren. Also, I don't know whether<br>it fits within the definition of Kings & Soldiers at<br>your site, but I have a nice script of Camelot (well,<br>I think it's nice) that I plan to release to ZoG in<br>the next couple of weeks. These are both games that I<br>hope will not be forgotten.<br><br>There was also a<br>GESS script (by LL Smith) posted to ZoG in the last<br>two or three months.<br><br>I think Gonnect would be<br>pretty hard to code mainly because Go and Hex just<br>aren't the sort of games Zillions was designed to handle<br>and I imagine the kludging that went into those<br>scripts would not combine well. But who knows? I've been<br>working on connection routines lately, and I know some<br>other coders have as well, so maybe somebody will<br>figure it out.<br><br>Dan</div>
