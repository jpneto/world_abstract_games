    <div>SuperDuperGames.org  First and foremost.  Aaron took a serious<br>interest in my games, programming all of them within a day or two of<br>release, a full two years ahead of the pack.  A friendly,<br>knowledgeable group of advanced gamers.  Best thing about SDG?  Aaron.<br> Good guy, and wholly dedicated to providing unique abstract games,<br>free of charge.  No Chess variants here.<br><br>ItsYourTurn.com  Simply massive.  Play Tanbo 'til you die.  There's an<br>endless supply of willing participants.  Internet response time is<br>instantaneous. Best site around if you're a hardcore Tanbo fan.<br><br>GoldToken.com  No shortage of players here either.  Dipole just came<br>online, and in the owner's words, "the first of our Mark Steere line<br>of games!"  At GoldToken I have my own game section, my own discussion<br>group, my own icon (a black hat), and friendship with a whole bunch of<br>nice people.  It'd be hard for me to think of something bad to say<br>about GoldToken.  Real hard.<br><br>BoardSpace.net  My personal favorite.  Dipole, my favorite game, is<br>played *live* at BoardSpace.  You don't make a move and then get<br>dressed and go out to dinner.  Once again, gameplay at BoardSpace is live.<br><br>Gamerz.net  Last but not least.  Richard was the first, many years<br>ago, to program Quadrature and Tanbo for his email server.  This put<br>me on the map.  Granted, a teeny, tiny dot on the map, but still on<br>the map.<br><br>Mark<br>marksteeregames.com</div>
