    <div>In play testing the way of go. I started<br>wondering whether I should add an "irreversible gain" rule<br>similar to the one in Epaminondas<br>which basically says<br>that if the opponent can match the gain one makes then<br>the gain is wiped out. In my game that means if one<br>side makes a capture in one turn and the opponent<br>immediately makes another capture in the following turn then<br>the captures doesn't contribute to the contract. This<br>of course opens the game up to possible draws but<br>might create a deeper game. The question than comes<br>down to the weighing of the disadvantage of having<br>draws with the advantage of depth. And which side is<br>heavier and more likely.<br><br>Any response appreciated.</div>
