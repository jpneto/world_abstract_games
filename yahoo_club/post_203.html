    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>> a new game called Dominions, by Christian Freeling (author of the <br>> games at the mindsports.net\Arena site. Apparently it's going to be <br>> added to the site soon, and it looks like the site will be <br>revamped. <br><br>Sorry but this game is not new. Christian didn't invent any games for <br>more than 15 years, because he was so fed up with gamers. The only <br>exception is probably Dameo. <br><br>I have a print-out of Dominions from March 9th of 2001. The address <br>was:<br><br>http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/CompleteGames/Territory/Dominions.html<br><br>and it is still there.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
