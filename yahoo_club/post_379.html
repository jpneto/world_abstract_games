    <div>I'd be glad to play some Diagonal 45 Twixt and some Y after the holidays.  I've been playing solitaire games of Y on the base-11 board, which works extremely well, though I haven't figured out how to notate it.  (Surely there's some easy method?) To anyone who hasn't tried it, I can't recommend curved Y highly enough.<br><br>There's actually no racing element in quadrant Hex.  Consider that each of the four small games is subject to the same laws that govern the large game.  Therefore if the board is completely filled with stones, one and only one player will win three or more out of the five games.  However I agree with you that quadrant Hex isn't a pure connection game, in the sense that it lacks a single focused goal.  (In a way it's a bit like a territorial game.)  Connection games derive some of their undeniable charm from the great simplicity of their objectives.<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: twixtplayer <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2002 3:06 AM<br>  Subject: Re: [Abstract Games] Twixt and Y: looking for opponents<br><br><br>  Mark's Diagonal Twixt is included as a variant in my Zillions Twixt <br>  package. I call it "Diagonal 45 Twixt" because the border rows are at <br>  a 45 degree angle to the grid. I also include "Diagonal 63 Twixt" <br>  where the borders run parallel to the direction of the links, <br>  approximately 63 degrees (or 27 degrees, depending on how you measure <br>  it) relative to the grid of holes. Some screen shots can be seen at <br>  http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/ZTwixt2.html<br><br>  The Twixt package is free, but you have to buy Zillions to use it, <br>  and the price just went up. We could send a diagonal Twixt image back <br>  and forth via email, or a Y board, if you want. I won't have time to <br>  play over the holidays, but maybe we can play a game after that?

It could <br>  develop into a race, which is contrary to what I want a Hex game to <br>  do.<br><br><br>  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br>  abstractgames-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br><br>  Your use of Yahoo!
