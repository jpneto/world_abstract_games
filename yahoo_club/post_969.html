    <div>hey gang,<br><br><br> i have put up a 20-page hyperlinked webbooklet of a sample Random<br>Xong game played recently.  there's loads of pictures and description. <br><br> i posted this note in rec.games.abstract, but forgot to put it here.<br><br> mark steere has already suggested i come up with some new games, as<br>this game has been around like the science project in the back of my<br>fridge.  and he is right, but i still had to get this up on the site.<br><br><br> http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/xonghome.html<br><br><br> i'd really appreciate some feed back.<br><br> thanks.<br><br><br><br>- nate, inventor of Xong[tm]</div>
