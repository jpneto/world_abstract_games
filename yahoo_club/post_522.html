    <div>>It's even more tasteless than Bombardment, and almost<br>>as tasteless as chess.<br><br>You, don't like Chess? :-; My preferred chess-like games are actually <br>Schachdame and Cheskers. Probably because I like checkers variants.<br><br><br>>I use blue and red all the time because they contrast well against a<br>>light background.  (This is partly a graphical representation issue<br>>for computer games).  Only in one game did I ascribe nationality to<br>>the colors, and in that case it was English (Red) and French (Blue).<br><br>BTW there is a game called "Blue and Grey", the colors are an allusion to <br>the uniforms worn during the American Civil War. It's a good game.<br><br><br><br>>Yearout didn't address the board size issue.<br><br>No, he didn't. But, nevertheless a game on a smaller board could not have <br>evoked his criticism.<br><br><br>>I hope to re-release it on 85 squares.  The game is derived from<br>>Gale/Bridg-it which I find fascinating to behold, although<br>>unfortunately it was solved.  I've never tried to publish anything<br>>commercially out of concern that the limited market and long odds of<br>>success don't justify the effort.<br><br>The newest trend I observed at one of the world largest game fairs which was <br>just a few weeks ago in Essen, Germany (150,000  visitors) is that, more and <br>more, inventors publish/market their games on their own. It's important that <br>you retain the copyright of your games so that you are in control of your <br>masterpieces. Another possibility would be to offer the game at Richard's <br>PBeM server or at brettspielwelt.de. Brettspiel.welt de offers so far only a <br>few abstract games: Yinsh, Dvonn and Cups (called "Bohnduell").<br><br><br>Ralf<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>E-Mails sind zu unpers�nlich?
