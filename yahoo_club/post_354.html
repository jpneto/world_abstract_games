I just meant that if you have found a game or two that you consider<br>exceptional, it would be nice if it or they could start seeing wider<br>circulation in English. There's certainly no rush and I don't mean to put<br>you on the spot. Thanks.<br> <br>-Mike Schoessow <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
