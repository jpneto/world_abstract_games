    <div>Not all rules of a game are equal. Some define the essence of the game<br>(like the existence of a royal piece in chess), others are just<br>adaptations in search of better dynamics and subtler positions (like<br>the queen's move range).<br><br>Even in abstract games, I tend to favor very short rules,<br>acknowledging the fact that some fixing may be needed to create a<br>proper rule set. I prefer games that focus on one sort of interaction<br>instead of several ones and exploit it elegant ways. Using this<br>criterion, Hex should be the most simple and deep game there is. The<br>case of Go comes near but... e.g., the KO rule is a kind of<br>second-order rule. It is a needed fix for a nasty consequence of the<br>capture rule and it would be hard to come up with a better replacement<br>but, nonetheless, KO is not the essence of Go. KO also implies extra<br>information besides the one in the board (like castling in chess<br>players must have memory of previous moves or positions) which,<br>personally, I find unaesthetic.<br><br>We may try to look to all the rules of a game and partition them into<br>the following (arbitrary) classification. First-order rules are the<br>essence of the game (and, possibly, are the criteria to define if a<br>variant belongs to the family of the standard or 'essential' game).<br>Second-order rules are those in order to make the game playable and<br>its dynamics as enjoyable as possible. Rules like these, if well<br>chosen, are a good pathway to create a fine abstract game (but, at<br>this moment, starts a new business: make all those rules interact<br>properly which is much more difficult than joining some unrelated good<br>ideas in the same pot). There are also third-order rules: extra rules<br>that provide little to nothing for the game essence except to<br>contribute artificially to the game dynamics.<br><br>I would say, for FIDE chess, castling and e.p. are 3rd order rules.<br>The piece movement of the FIDE army is 2nd order (remember Betza's<br>different armies for other instances of chess soldiers) and also the<br>one piece per turn move sequence (progressive variants still use the<br>knowledge and instinct from chess experience). The concept of royal<br>piece and capture by replacement would be first-order.<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Jo=E3o Pedro Neto</div>
