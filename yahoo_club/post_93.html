    <div>Joao Neto wrote in his homepage:<br><br>Go-moku<br>is an ancient Japanese game.The full<br>name,<br>"Go-moku Narabe," literally means "five stones in a row."<br>In Japan, a more complex version of the game exists,<br>known as Renju. Check more information at playSite, and<br>you can read a recent Thesis presenting the solution<br>of Go-moku (Black wins!).<br><br>(1) I thought<br>"narabe" is a grammatical form of "naraberu" = to line<br>s.th. up.<br><br>(2) Gomoku narabe is nothing else than<br>Renju played under a "free way play system".<br><br><br>(3) It was proofed by Japanese Renju professionals<br>that the game is a sure win for Black. This was<br>published in:<br><br>Goro Sakata, Wataru Ikawa.<br>Five-in-a-row (Renju). The Ishi Press, Tokyo 1981.<br><br>Page<br>52:<br><br>"A Sure Win.<br>There are 24 basic opening patterns<br>in Renju and each one of them has josekis (opening<br>formulas), perfect and imperfect. In this book the josekis<br>of the following patterns will be thoroughly<br>examined [HOGETSU -- KAGETSU].<br>When you have completely<br>mastered all the josekis which develop from the two<br>patterns above, you are 100% sure of a win under the<br>following two conditions: (1) you are Black, and (2) are<br>playing under a free play sytem [i.e. Gomoku<br>narabe].<br><br>This book is well-known in Europe (at least among Go<br>players). For that reason it can be assumed that L. V.<br>Allis and H. J. van den Herik received their PhD<br>because of fraudulent claims.<br><br>Panther</div>
