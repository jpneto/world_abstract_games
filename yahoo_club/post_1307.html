    <div>I have an idea pertaining to abstract games -- someone should start a<br>Yahoo Group devoted to them! I mean a group where people would discuss<br>ideas pertinent to abstract games, and where posts that do not pertain<br>to abstract games are regularly deleted by the moderator. Even if it<br>doesn't get as many posts as this group does, it would be more<br>interesting to read because the posts would contain so much less<br>distracting garbage.<br><br>Maybe I should start such a group. Another advantage is that this<br>would allow this present group to be devoted entirely to flame wars.<br>Would anyone be interested in joining?<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
