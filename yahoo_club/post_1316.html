    <div>I just played a game of Dipole with someone, if you can call it a<br>game.  He removed all 12 of his checkers from the board on his first<br>turn.  That was a new record.  The next highest number of checkers<br>removed by one of my opponents on a first turn was six I believe. <br>This was the tenth time this particular individual had played Dipole.<br><br>People who have absolutely no understanding of the rules of Dipole<br>constitute the largest group of repeat, online Dipole players,<br>paradoxically.  They simply enjoy making program allowed, though<br>otherwise random moves and watching how the game plays out.  I looked<br>at the record of another individual who had no understanding of the<br>rules, and she had won about a third of the 150 games of Dipole she<br>had played.<br><br>I don't understand how playing a game over and over again with no<br>understanding of the rules and no interest in learning the rules could<br>possibly be entertaining to anyone, never mind the largest group of<br>players.  Maybe I'm just not appreciating something.</div>
