    <div>>For instance, one page shows the 14 <br>> different types of pentagon that will tile a plane.<br><br>The Cairo tiling is one of those 14.  It has advantages over many <br>other non-regular tilings in that it is monohedral (all the same <br>face) and isohedral (every face has the same "relative position" to <br>the surrounding faces).  However, you can't easily start at one Cairo <br>pentagon and move in a straight line to a row of other cells, as you <br>can on a square or hexagonal grid.  Blobz (= Cairo-ized "Blobs" <br>or "Ataxx" or "Spot") is a good example of a game that allows this <br>kind of transplanting, because it doesn't involve pieces moving long <br>distances.<br><br>There are plenty of monohedral tilings, though as John Lawson says, <br>the only regular polygons that will tile the plane are equilateral <br>triangles, squares, and regular hexagons.  I can't think of any games <br>on other monohedral tilings either, apart from original ones that <br>haven't been tested (or that haven't passed).<br><br>One idea that I haven't done anything with involves a non-convex <br>equilateral pentagon, angles 36 degrees, 108 degrees, 108 degrees, 36 <br>degrees, and (a reflex angle) 252 degrees.  This pentagon has the <br>property of being able to tile the plane in a great many ways -- you <br>can hardly put the tiles together in such as way as to make it <br>impossible to fit another one in.  Also, they're mirror-symmetric, so <br>they could be flipped over without disturbing the array.<br><br>I would make a good number of these in stiff cardboard, black on one <br>side and white on the other like Othello pieces, and play them on a <br>mat with a large ellipse drawn on it, where they aren't allowed to <br>lap over the edge of the ellipse.  The idea would be that the first <br>player places a tile with his color showing, then the players <br>alternately place tiles edge-adjacent to a tile already played, and <br>somehow a player "captures" pieces of the other color by flipping <br>them, as in Othello.  That's the rule that I haven't figured out.  <br>But if one could find such a rule that would lead to a good game, it <br>would have the interesting property of being completely abstract and <br>yet having an infinite number of possible opening moves...<br><br>Mark Thompson<br>Chicago, IL</div>
