    <div>Let's say you have multiple games, and you are trying them for the<br>first time.  Neither player knows which side has an advantage. What is<br>the fair way to do this?  When said you flip a coin, there is an<br>argument that the flipping of a coin to decide games makes the game in<br>question no longer an abstract strategy game (and, as described below,<br>it ends up no longer being part of tournament play for an association<br>of abstract strategy games).  So, what exactly is the fair way to pick<br>sides?<br><br>Anyone have an answer here?  I ask this, because I am looking to have<br>certain tournaments that would surprise players with games they have<br>never seen before (as a measure of creative problem solving instead of<br>memorizing lines of play).  It is important to answer how to do this<br>fairly for tournament play.  <br><br>If anyone can chime in here with an answer, it would be appreciated. <br>Even cases of where mutators are added (a set of standard rules<br>changers), or the board is modified in any way (where players never<br>saw it before), the ability to evaluate which side has an advantage<br>likely is unknown.<br><br>I also had the idea of having players play both sides, shot down for<br>some reason also here, so what exactly do you do here?<br><br>Thank you for your time...<br>- Rich</div>
