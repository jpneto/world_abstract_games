    <div>Sure, my article is at:<br><a href=http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/game_thoughts.html target=new>http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/game_thoughts.html</a><br><br>I've read some places where "depth" is defined as the<br>number of distinct levels at which human beings can<br>play. You can make them distinct by requiring, say,<br>that players at level (n+1) can consistently beat<br>players at level n in two games out of three. Then the<br>number of levels suggests how much human beings can<br>learn about the game, which also suggests how long it<br>will hold people's interest.</div>
