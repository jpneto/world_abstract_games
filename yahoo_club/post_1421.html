    <div>I don't know how many of you have noticed Versus. It is designed by <br>Michel Pinon and you can play it online for free here:<br><br>http://www.versus-le-jeu.net/<br><br>It will get a limited release probably by the end of April.<br><br>Versus uses an interesting concept as your main Versus piece is used <br>to attract pieces closer to it and change their ownership.<br><br>The only problem i noticed after a couple of games online is that the <br>game may drag near the end.</div>
