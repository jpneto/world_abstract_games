    <div>What makes you think your were disqualified if you were not notified <br>of it? <br>I entered a game, was informed that it was received and only found <br>out that i did not win when the contest was over. Considering that <br>they had 50 or more entries i can see why they would not take the <br>time to contact each designer personally.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "interrupt27" <llsmith@e...> <br>wrote:<br>> I submitted two games to this competition: SanQi and Splotch.<br>> <br>> I was informed that they were received.
