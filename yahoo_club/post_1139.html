    <div>I'm back. I had a look at my first draft i sent you (which was actually my second draft). I've got a few changed to make, to clarify certain points & will send you the new draft asap. Yes, the board is complicated looking, but as i said in my last email i am looking to make it look really basic, as in a 'Go' board. I had an idea on holiday about using triangles instead of squares (& maybe making the board into a lotus flower pattern) but haven't looked into it yet.<br>   <br>  Hope you got the first draft i sent & you get the basic idea.<br>   <br>  Regards<br>  Colin<br><br>Dave Dyer <ddyer-yahoogroups1@...> wrote:<br>          <br>I agree with Mark that a cube could result in a game which combines<br>statistical analysis with the original game, and that wouldn't necessarily<br>be good.
