    <div>In Harlequin Checkers pieces move diagonally but capture orthogonally.  This is an attempt to create the "best of both worlds" - the forced progression of the diagonal game combined with the use of the full board and range of captures of the orthogonal game.<br><br>Draws are very rare and can only occur in endgame situations involing a lone king vs. 2 kings that are both on the same diagonal plane (e.g. the one side's 2 kings are both on black spaces).  In endgames where one side's pieces all occupy the same diagonal plane then 3 kings are the minimum to capture an enemy lone king.  Otherwise only 2 kings are needed if they each are on a seperate diagonal plane to capture a lone enemy king.<br><br>Because pieces don't capture in the same direction they move, this creates unique situations not seen in other forms of checkers, such as a single piece blockading a corner piece.<br><br>The nature of play remains consistent throughout.  The diagonal plane is used strictly for movement; the orthogonal plane strictly for captures.  This is different than Croda which is essentially orthogonal checkers with a temporary slight diagonal movement forced upon the men. Or Armenian Checkers which mixes diagonal movement with orthoganal movement & capture.  Armenian Checkers suffers from offering the player too many possibilities and not enough limitations.<br><br>The rules for Harlequin Checkers can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/71218?do=3Dshow;id=3D1692</div>
