    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>This looks interesting.  I'd like to try it if/when it shows up on<br>iggamecenter.  I imagine it might be kind of frustrating to play on an<br>actual board due to the lack of something like the numbers hovering over<br>figure 3.  As a computer game tho, you could easily show all available moves<br>and the value of each piece.<br><br>An earlier version of a game I'm working on required some value calculation<br>like that and several of the folks I playtested it with complained about the<br>calculation required. One calling it a lack of "transparency"....<br><br>-Simon<br><br><br>On Sun, Mar 14, 2010 at 9:49 PM, mark_steere <mark_steere@...> wrote:<br><br>><br>><br>> Jostle is a combinatorial game:<br>> http://www.marksteeregames.com/Jostle_Go_rules.pdf<br>><br>> -Mark<br>><br>> Mark Steere Games<br>> http://marksteeregames.com<br>><br>>  <br>><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
