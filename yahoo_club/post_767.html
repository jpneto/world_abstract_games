    <div>I am new to the group. I am walter joris, author of "100 strategic <br>games for pen and paper". Website: www.walterjoris.be. Do you know the <br>game that is called "morpion solitaire"? Mathematicians will love it! <br>I call it in my book connector (it has many names). Just type 'morpion <br>solitaire" in google, and you'll find many sites, some in English, <br>most in French. I just wrote a complete paper about this game, <br>unfortunately only in Dutch, for a math magazine.</div>
