    <div>A friend of mine told me today about an abstract game he saw at a <br>game store but he can't recall the name. His description was as <br>follows.<br><br>The game board was about a foot square and checked, light/dark like a <br>chess board, and 4X4 or it may have been 5X5.<br> <br>The pieces looked like inverted cups and when he picked one up there <br>was a smaller one under it and another even smaller one under that.<br><br>The board and the pieces were wood or at least were made to look like <br>wood. Some pieces were light and some dark. <br><br>The game was on display near the cash register and when he commented <br>on it the cashier mentioned that it had won an award.<br><br><br>If anyone knows what game this describes I would appreciate hearing. <br>I'm intrigued by the idea of nested pieces. It seems to me that such <br>an arrangement opens some interesting possibilities for movement <br>mechanics in a game.<br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Mike Schoessow<br><br>mschoessow@...</div>
