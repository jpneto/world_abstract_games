    <div>Good to hear from you, Steve.  I've pretty much given up on figuring out Flume, but Lessons in Play sounds like a fascinating read in its own right.  I'm traveling back to California from Florida tomorrow (visiting the parents) and the book should arrive a couple days after that.<br><br>Wesley Tanaka (games.wtanaka.com) and I played several games of 5x5 Flume in a clumsy attempt to uncover its secrets.  The game is almost trivial at that size, but the only thing that emerged was a strong first move advantage (at that size).  For us, Flume flatly refused to be linked with Dots and Boxes theory, or to reveal any significant insights.  The more we studied it, the more intractable it became.<br><br>Though Flume has an arguably simpler rule set than D&B, it's play seems to be more convoluted.  D&B theory depends on the fact that the walls can only be built in one set of locations and boxes can only be centered in a another, distinct set of locations.  In Flume there's no such distinction in location sets.  A wall segment or a claimed cell (in a multi-move turn) could appear at any location.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Steven Meyers" <swmeyers@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I can also vouch for Lessons in Play.

Wolfe has another book which he co-authored with Michael Albert and Richard Nowakowski which is specifically a textbook on CGT.
