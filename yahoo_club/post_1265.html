Thanks, Joao! It's also been<br>> influenced by Cosmic Encounter, Knightmare Chess, the GIPF Project,<br>> and a lot more. "Frames" are a lot like mutators, except broader and<br>> looser -- not as rigorous, and more like a game expansion than like a<br>> single rule.<br><br>Sorry about that Ron.  It was discussed in another thread in a post<br>that Joe happened to post.  I happened to just post it separately,<br>just to give it its own space, not thinking about who initially<br>discussed it.  I know Joao's post was on my mind with it, but I do<br>also recall we did discuss this.  My mind has been really focused on<br>the IAGO World Tour, so I tend to slip on who said what.  I need to<br>get these tournaments line up and the website for the IAGO World Tour<br>working right and updated.  For example, the Arimaa World Championship<br>is part of the IAGO World Tour now, but the I need to get the calendar<br>updated.  The holiday season means everything moves slower than necessary.<br><br>Anyhow, feel free to spin your perspective on here.</div>
