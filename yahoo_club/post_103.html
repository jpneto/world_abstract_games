    <div>Hmm. That version should also be tested, I<br>suppose. I think I decided on double-moves because the<br>player who needs two parallel lines needs both White and<br>Black to have equal presence on the board. The other<br>player just needs one color to be stronger, so I think<br>he would decide early which color he's playing for<br>and always place a stone of that color. I think that<br>would make it very hard for the other player to<br>win.<br><br>But I don't know for certain. That version probably<br>also should be tested.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Mark<br>Thompson</div>
