    <div>I was only suggesting that some of your statements were opinions, not<br>someone else's opinions.  I wouldn't have mentioned it at all if your<br>opinions didn't stand in stark contrast with my own.<br><br>> ... IMO (thanks Mark - for the record, if I ever post anyone<br>> else's opinions, I'll be sure to credit them.  Otherwise, assume<br>> everything I post is my own opinion.)<br>></div>
