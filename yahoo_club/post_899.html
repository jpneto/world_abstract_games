    <div>> But besides all those, there are original games like Byte and Impasse,<br>> Archimedes and Loa, playable with standard checkers equipment, that<br>> more people could be enjoying.<br><br>Not to forget Three Crowns featured in Abstract Games Magazine ... <br><br>BTW "Standard Checkers equipment" differs according to the place you <br>are: France (10x10) board, Tamils in Sri Lanka (12x12) board, irregular <br>boards in Mauretania and Kavkaz (the latter occupied by Russia since <br>the mid 18th century). It becomes even more difficult to define <br>Draughts when it comes to modern variants. <br><br>Ralph</div>
