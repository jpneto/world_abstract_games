    <div>I see your point now. I'll have to think more<br>about it. But I think the situation you point out is<br>actually in keeping with what I want. I imagine something<br>of the the following line of logic, though to<br>actually create a case for it will be hard:<br><br> let<br>the side attempting the capture be A and the other<br>side B.<br><br> First A create a multiple threat which<br>B cannot get out of and always ends with B<br>threatening some piece of A so after B's move A can always<br>ponce on B. And since placement is required in every<br>turn the board fills up so the situation is bound to<br>happen since there will be no room to avoid<br>it.<br><br>Thanks again</div>
