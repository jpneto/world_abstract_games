    <div>> I agree that draughts might not be the best example<br>> for clarity, and hex might work better as a good<br>> example for decisiveness than bad for drama.  <br><br>Checkers may not be the better example, but I would like you people <br>to give me some!! :-) Known games are not that many, and in many <br>positions, a regular checker player may see many moves in advance.<br><br>> Speaking of drama, all positions in abstract games<br>> (meaning lacking in both hidden information and<br>> randomizers) are definitively 'winning', 'losing' or<br>> 'drawn'.  The only sense in which finer-grained ideas<br>> of a 'weaker' or 'stronger' position are meaningful is<br>> through failure of the players to completely perceive<br>> the structure of the game, either through strong depth<br>> or weak clarity.<br><br>Of course. An abstract game is a producer of positions which are <br>theorems with demonstrations of HUGE, superhuman complexity. A <br>player do not want to know those, the pleasure comes precisely from <br>that subtle form of ignorance.<br><br>>  So I suppose that a game with good<br>> 'drama' is one where there is an easily-perceived<br>> indicator that correlates strongly (but not reliably)<br>> with won positions.  <br><br>Clarity favors a way to find the best move given a position (e.g.,  <br>the effort to look more and more moves ahead should not increase <br>very rapidly). But that does not mean it should strongly correlate <br>with a win position. The initial GOMOKU/RENJU moves are very clear, <br>but the winning position can hardly be recovered by it (at least for <br>amateur players).<br><br>Now, drama, as you said, seems that should have that type of <br>feature. If it is not rare to find positions that seem won but with  <br>a nasty little tactic that still give the adversary some hope... <br>Hamlet, that is drama :^)<br><br>Of course, if those positions are way too often, the game will lose <br>decisiveness (as stated in Mark's article).<br><br>Jo=E3o<br><br><br><br><br>=</div>
