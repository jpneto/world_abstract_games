    <div>Hello,  <br><br>>  > Today I translated Cislovane kameny ("number stones") a Russian <br>game <br>>  > from the early 1980s (probably "kameni nomeri" in Russian). <br><br>i just started wondering whether I *really* understood all the rules <br>of Cislovane kameny. What is the strengths of the stones? Just the <br>(4) number(s) at the edges?  What is the meaning of the large number <br>in the center? Has it also something to do with the strength of the <br>piece? I probaby missed something. <br> <br>> can you post any of your translations for some of the better games? <br><br>would you like one of the Draughts variants?<br><br>truthforum</div>
