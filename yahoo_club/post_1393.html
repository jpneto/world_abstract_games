    <div>Hello,<br>With all due respect, please take a look at<br>www.usgo.org/bobhighlibrary and scroll down for some of my articles<br>and those of others. In addition, go's influence on western<br>mathematics and computer studies along with its history in Japan and<br>Korea is outlined in the history section (70 pages) of my first book,<br>'Go! More Than a Game.'<br>Best,<br>Peter <br><br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "mark_steere" <mark_steere@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Peter Shotwell <bixleco@> wrote:<br>> > <br>> > Peter Shotwell is an internationally known expert <br>> > on the relationship of Go to Eastern and Western <br>> > philosophy, literature, and history. <br>> ><br>> <br>> Go's relationship to literature is that it has been written about. <br>> Go's relationship to history is that it has been played.  Go has<br>> absolutely zero influence on philosophy, military strategy, government<br>> policy, lifestyles of the rich and famous, or anything else in<br>> society.  Go is a board game.  Its sole purpose is entertainment.<br>></div>
