    <div>Mark's Diagonal Twixt is included as a variant in my Zillions Twixt <br>package. I call it "Diagonal 45 Twixt" because the border rows are at <br>a 45 degree angle to the grid. I also include "Diagonal 63 Twixt" <br>where the borders run parallel to the direction of the links, <br>approximately 63 degrees (or 27 degrees, depending on how you measure <br>it) relative to the grid of holes. Some screen shots can be seen at <br>http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/ZTwixt2.html<br><br>The Twixt package is free, but you have to buy Zillions to use it, <br>and the price just went up. We could send a diagonal Twixt image back <br>and forth via email, or a Y board, if you want. I won't have time to <br>play over the holidays, but maybe we can play a game after that? My <br>email is twixt@...<br><br>Thanks for the Y images, Mark!<br><br>Quadrant Hex does not appeal to my purist aesthetics. It could <br>develop into a race, which is contrary to what I want a Hex game to <br>do.</div>
