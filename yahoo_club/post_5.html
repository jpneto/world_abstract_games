    <div>I don't think the depth of a game could be<br>computed by a mathematical algorithm. The crucial point<br>about the definition is the reference to a community of<br>human players.<br><br>Depth is a measure of how a human<br>being learns a game, which is not (anyway not yet)<br>algorithmically definable. I think finding a way to compute depth<br>would be tantamount to building a machine that is<br>intelligent in the same way human beings are intelligent --<br>one that could do EVERYTHING people can do, including<br>make mistakes, get distracted or tired, daydream when<br>it's supposed to be working, etc.<br><br>Actually I<br>discuss depth, and the human factor in games, at some<br>length in an article on my website.</div>
