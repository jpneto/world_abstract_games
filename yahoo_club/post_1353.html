    <div>Figured it would be worth posting on here, because it hadn't been<br>posted yet.<br><br>Fischer helped to raise chess to new heights when he was around, which<br>in turn, helped to cause a bunch of new abstract strategy games to<br>appear in the 1970s, and into the 1980s, by companies like Lakeside<br>and Hasbro.</div>
