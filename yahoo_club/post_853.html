    <div>Besides this post, I got another abusive email from Mark Steere to my <br>private e-mail account as well as at least 30 other people. This is <br>clearly criminal conduct which shouldn't tolerated on this forum. I ask <br>you to remove Mark Steere from this forum and to report his behavior to <br>the support team of Yahoo!Groups.<br><br>Actually you have to do it according to the law, otherwise you would <br>incur a penalty.<br><br>Ralf <br><br><br>> I too would only like to discuss abstract games here.  Sorry to <br>> arrive on an unpleasant note.  As soon as I got here I saw Byte <br>> mentioned along with a desperate plea for help.  Henceforth I will <br>> not respond to memos from Herman Gering in this forum.</div>
