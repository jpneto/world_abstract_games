    <div>> Obviously the most advanced French players don't agree with you.<br><br>Hardly obvious. It's curious how you always find it necessary to <br>remark on the nationality of a game, or of a person, as a way of <br>expressing your idea of the value of their opinion. It isn't <br>persuasive to those of us who don't think of people primarily as <br>nationalistic stereotypes. In fact, it's really rather offensive, as <br>I've tried to point out before.</div>
