    <div>Wow, that's a tough order, and I'm not well-versed in the area, but<br>I've had a few thoughts on mutators for tournament play. <br>First, there has to be a very limited number, though this could easily<br>go into the hundreds [or thousands!]. Mutators, as I understand them,<br>seem to asymptotically approach infinity. As interactions get complex,<br>unlimited mutator lists would lead to chaos and worse, worse being the<br>inability to define the rules in a consistent manner.<br>Second, I suggest effectively eliminating mutators of certain "types".<br>The "switch sides" mutator should not be used, as this would encourage<br>poor play with the expectation of gaining later. Neither should a<br>"move opponent's pieces" mutator be used. Without severe restrictions,<br>these kinds of mutators pretty much have the effect of cheating, it<br>seems to me. Certainly, they would work against the precept of how<br>well one plays should determine the outcome. Yes, with them, how one<br>plays using them would determine the outcome, but they force<br>suboptimum game play from the initial state, which I think would be<br>inimical to IAGO's purpose.<br>Third, how, when, and how long a mutator or several mutators take<br>effect would need to be strictly determined in advance.<br>I can see this being doable for a very restricted set of mutators, and<br>it would be an interesting and somewhat novel approach to most<br>abstract games, but it would be an amazing series of headaches for the<br>people figuring it out.</div>
