    <div>Hi Shinermons,<br><br>Thank you.  Tanbo has a magnificent architecture.  A a small<br>percentage of people are fanatical about playing it.  It's my most<br>well known game and it continues to grow every year.<br><br>A much larger percentage of people find Tanbo gameplay a little dry. <br>Dipole is my most well thought of game.  Drawbacks: it's hard to learn<br>just by playing.  You have to actually read the rules.<br><br>You can see all of my games at http://marksteeregames.com<br><br>-Mark<br><br><shinermonsgames@...> wrote:<br>><br>> For Mark Steere<br>>    <br>>   Hi, i just had a look on super duper and saw Tanbo - it looks<br>interesting. I'll give it a go<br>>    <br>>   Shinermons</div>
