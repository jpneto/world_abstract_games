Kavkaz Dama looks the most intriguing<br>to me because of its fairly close movement connection to the ancestor<br>Alquerque in the sense that the armies are close together at the beginning<br>of the game and movement in eight directions is allowed. At the same time<br>the game includes the compulsory capture rule which didn't show up in these<br>types of games until the mid 19th century. As for the winner, it seems to me<br>that since only forward or diagonally forward movement is allowed except<br>when capturing (that's how I interpreted the rules) the game would<br>ultimately reach a point at which neither player could legally move. Then<br>the player who moved last would be the winner. Maybe I'm missing something<br>here since I have not yet played the game but this seems like this would be<br>a viable (although unusual in this case) winning condition.<br> <br>-Mike schoessow <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
