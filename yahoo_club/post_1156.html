    <div>> What I am trying to go for now is the one stop place on the Internet<br>> to find all abstract strategy games.<br><br>That sounds hopeless--abstract strategy games are countless and are<br>being invented all the time.<br><br>There's a traditional, technical literature in which the term<br>"abstract strategy game" is used in a way that excludes Backgammon,<br>because of the dice rolls, and Kriegspiel, because the players make<br>their decisions without perfect information. I think this meaning of<br>the term is important and worth preserving, so I would recommend that<br>you not include such games on your list. But it's your list and the<br>internet, like language, always evolves by the participation of large<br>numbers of people.<br><br>Mark</div>
