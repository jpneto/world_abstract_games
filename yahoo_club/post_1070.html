    <div>See also:<br><br>http://www.talkaboutgaming.com/group/rec.games.abstract/messages/12591.html<br><br>The game was removed from Mark Steere's homepage, BoardGameGeek and<br>Super Duper Games according to a recent Google search. <br><br>> Bertram Felgenhauer discovered a flaw in Levee.  He created an<br>> algorithm which guarantees a win for the first player to move.  Levee<br>> can no longer be considered a valid game.<br><br>Another Mark Steere game which is obviously flawed is Tanbo. The first<br>player wins more than 70% of all games.<br><br>-----------------<br>Mike Tery:<br><br>"Boy that'd be embarrassing, wouldn't it?  I hope I never release a<br>game with such an obvious flaw."</div>
