    <div>> >How do we spell games?<br>><br>>I think it's entirely up to the game designer to specify how the game<br>>should be spelled, and that includes the use of upper and lower case,<br>>hyphens, numbers, and other special symbols.<br><br>Thanks. Now, I can at least insist that "my" games should all be spelled <br>with upper cases. Anyway, I'm German and, according to some religious <br>groups, German is God's own language. The first German Reich was called the <br>Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (note: holy = German). Emperor <br>Barbarossa (who just barely spoke German) is still sleeping in the <br>Kyffhï¿½user mountain to return one day and save our people. Am I kidding?<br><br><br>What do YOU, beloved native speaker of English, the holy language of the <br>most holy King James version, inspired by the Holy Spirit, not by human <br>failure, think about the following spellings:<br><br>* Cross-kalah<br><br>* Space walk<br><br>* go<br><br>* Chess<br><br>* settlers of Catan<br><br>Ralf</div>
