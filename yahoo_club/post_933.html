    <div>> Using your definitions, I cannot see how the "one piece per turn move<br>> sequence" would be a so-called second order rule.  I would consider<br>> this one of the most basic concepts of game playing.  I would state<br>> that games that have a rule permitting more than "one piece per turn<br>> move sequence" would be utilizing a second order rule.<br><br>But moving two or more pieces changes the essence of chess?<br>Progressive chess feels like any other chess variant and you move<br>several pieces per turn. The "one piece per turn" rule is not<br>essential to define a chess-like game. At least not as the "capture by<br>replacement" rule or the "royal piece" concept.<br><br>Anyway, I acknowledge that this idea is not very objective, there is<br>no direct and unambiguous way to split the rules of a game into those<br>three order rules.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Jo=E3o<br><br>=</div>
