    <div>Looking over the current list of signatures, I couldn't help but <br>notice that all 27 signers appear to be men.  Perhaps something can be <br>done to redress this gross imbalance.  It may be that IAGO's strong <br>emphasis on competition (crowining a world champion for individual <br>games and crowning an overall world champion) has alienated some women <br>who might otherwise be interested in joining.  Maybe if the <br>competitive aspect of the association were de-emphasized, and the <br>social aspect (e.g. exchanging gaming ideas and posting thoughts on <br>strategy and tactics) were emphasized, IAGO might achieve a better <br>balance?<br><br>Steve<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> Hello all.
