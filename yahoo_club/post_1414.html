    <div>hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br><br>Rich asked can you buy variant pieces commercially. Yep, have seen <br>them on a website.<br><br>He mentioned commecially available, I'd guess there are near 20 <br>commecially availble variants for chess exist now, some out of print <br>yes, but out there.<br><br>tournaments, some variants that are internationally recognized such <br>as shogi, xiangqi have them already. Some like Omega have <br>organization pushing them now.<br><br>I am completely missing what this new project would add to the mix.<br><br>Even the talk about chess evolving, WOW it has done that in spades <br>since it was Chatarunga. I mean there are a dozen chess variants <br>which have evolved in different counties, Sittuyin, Makruk, Shatar, <br>Janngi, Shogi etc<br><br>Commercially available, the wonderful Omega set, beautiful pieces, <br>great concepts, Dragon a gorgeous set, Grand, Gothic, Neo, Proteus, <br>Hexagonal (about 3 different versions alone), Noble Celts (the game <br>in the round)etc<br><br>If anything there are too many that the casual player has a hard time <br>knowing where to move to once he gets the itch to go to a variant.<br><br>The world has done what seems to be the goal here, and I susoect will <br>continue to do it.<br><br>Talisinbear<br><br><br><br>> > ><br>> > > Um, isn't this why www.chessvariants.com already exists?

But it is as about as<br>> much of a living and playable form of chess, as a chess glossary is<br>> for chess.  What is meant by the Chess of Tomorrow project is to <br>take<br>> the CV site one more step and actually get it played in tournament<br>> formats, and facilitate the growth of both Chess variants and FIDE<br>> itself.  It is to take the best of the best found, and have it <br>finally<br>> played and recognized as a legitimate form.  It is also meant <br>provide<br>> possible migration paths FIDE chess could take.  In other words, <br>have<br>> Chess again be a continually evolving game, with a robust enough<br>> framework that it can handle change, and integrate the fullness of<br>> experience into the chess world.  The idea here is to ask people to<br>> speak on it, and give their two cents towards this.<br>> <br>> Pretty much here, systematize and organize it from a playing<br>> perspective so the goals of the variant community are filled greater<br>> than they are now.  A simple measure of whether or not things are <br>the<br>> way they are now is to ask this: Can you buy variant pieces anywhere<br>> on this planet?  I don't mean MAKE your own, but buy your own.  If <br>you<br>> are not able to, what does that say about the state of things?  Is<br>> Chess Variants supposed to be just some sort of side freak show with<br>> no commercial viability so people who are willing to play, will be<br>> able to play?  Will it grown enough to be there?<br>></div>
