    <div>I've been in Paris last week, and I visited one very nice shop with <br>many board games. I've found it because a friend living there told me <br>about it.<br><br>It would be nice to have a list of shops around the world that only <br>sells board games and puzzles. Do you know any one in your home towns?<br><br>I will start that list at:<br>   http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/shops.htm<br><br>Cheers, Joao Neto</div>
