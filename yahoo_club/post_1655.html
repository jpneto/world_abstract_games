    <div>What do you think about Cage? <br><br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br><br>  I've tried out Cage several times but I'm not sure I've understood the rules correctly.  You state that there's 4 types of moves:  restricted, centering, adjoining and jump.  But it seems to me there's only three types: centering, adjoining and jump; and they are all *subject to the restrictions* that you described. Also I'm not sure what types of moves can be part of a multi-move turn; certainly the jump move can be (since there can be a multiple jump sequence) but what about centering and adjoining moves?<br><br>  Steve<br><br><br><br>  <br><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>  No virus found in this incoming message.<br>  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com <br>  Version: 9.0.851 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/3135 - Release Date: 09/14/10 14:34:00<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
