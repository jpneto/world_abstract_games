Interrupt is getting a little over-the-top. This is like <br>saying, "insisting that a waltz be in 3/4 time will stifle creativity <br>and lead to stagnation." You can compose any music or any game you <br>want, the only question is what the result should be called so that <br>people will know what it is.<br><br>> A game needs not to be<br>> called "abstract" to be "successful"!<br><br>Indeed, at least in the U.S. the abstracts are probably the least <br>successful.<br><br>Anyone who has to start attacking the imagined motivations of someone <br>he's arguing with has run out of ideas.</div>
