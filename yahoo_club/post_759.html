    <div>> Joao Neto calls Tower of Power erroneously "Tours". One should use <br>> the name which was given by the author of a game, not that of a <br>> French translation.<br>> <br>> Bad description:<br>> http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/tours.htm<br>> <br>> Excellent description:<br>> http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/MancalaGames/TowerofPower<br><br>Ralf,<br><br>Of course one should use the original name, unless one does not know <br>it... And when one knows the real name, one should replace it. We <br>two had this talk last year, and I replace the french name by the <br>english name at that time (I see you got the initial reference from <br>1976, thanks!)<br><br>But, besides that obvious comment, does my webpage has some errors <br>in the rules? I would like to know, so I could change and correct it.<br><br>Cheers, Jo=E3o Neto</div>
