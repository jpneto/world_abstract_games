    <div>It seems to me that there are two slightly different arguments going on here<br>and that people are talking past each other. I don't believe that anyone is<br>trying to change the formal definition of "abstract game" as it applies to<br>the mathematics of combinatorial game theory. Rather, I believe some people<br>are frustrated with the assertion that the definition used in this<br>discussion forum must strictly adhere to the formal mathematical definition<br>and that any game which does not meet all the criteria of this definition<br>should not be discussed here. In my opinion this is unreasonable. I offer<br>the following thoughts for for consideration;<br> <br>1) I'm not an authority but didn't someone post earlier that abstract games<br>as defined under combinatorial game theory must always end as a result of<br>one player being unable to move? If this is the case, then games such as<br>Chess, Twixt, Hex, and many others would, strictly speaking, by this<br>definition, not be considered abstract games. If an exception is made for<br>this, then logically it should be acceptable to entertain other exceptions<br>to the definition as well.<br> <br>2) I'm assuming that this discussion group is not only for combinatorial<br>game theorists, although they are of course welcome as far as I'm concerned.<br>Many people aren't familiar with formal game theory and probably believe<br>that "abstract game" means a game that is abstract, with the word abstract<br>itself being defined according to one of its dictionary definitions. This<br>certainly seems reasonable to me and I have no problem with such a<br>definition in the context of this discussion group.<br> <br>3) There are some good themeless (or almost themeless) games with no luck<br>that support more than two players and I have no problem with such games<br>being included under the umbrella of this discussion group. It also wouldn't<br>spoil my day if I saw the occasional post on a game such as Backgammon which<br>is a themeless game that has some hidden information.<br> <br>4)This is not a particularly active discussion group these days. If I had to<br>wade through dozens of posts per day, such as with spielfrieks, then maybe<br>it would make sense to me to think about narrowing the scope of the group,<br>but as it is I welcome discussion of any game that can be reasonably called<br>abstract by either the dictionary definition or the definition as used in<br>formal game theory. <br> <br>5) If the disagreements that have been posted here reflect frustration with<br>seeing posts that violate the strict formal definition of the name of the<br>group (i.e., "these are interesting but they shouldn't be posted HERE", as<br>opposed to, "I'm not interested in these and I don't want to have to sort<br>through them") , then perhaps this could be addressed by making some changes<br>to the introductory page for the group in terms of defining what is or is<br>not appropriate material for posting here.<br> <br>-Mike Schoessow<br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: truthforum2001 [mailto:Peace_Panther@...]<br>Sent: Thursday, July 04, 2002 4:04 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Zarcana / Interrupt's weird behaviour<br><br><br><br><br>> I made no attack on any particular individual's motivations, I<br>merely <br>> stated an observation.<br><br>You are ridicilous.  <br><br>> Random <br>> generators are acceptable.<br><br>You are in the wrong group.<br><br><br>> Can there be abstract card games?
