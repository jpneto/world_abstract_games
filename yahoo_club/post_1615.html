    <div>I guess wrapped up in all this is: our ability to observe and comprehend.<br><br>I can't read sheet music.  But I have a friend who can read music and can<br>"hear" it as he reads it.<br><br>Similarly, I can imagine someone who makes church bells is familiar enough<br>with them that he can "hear" the sound one might make before striking it.<br><br>I can read the rules to a game and understand them pretty well just by<br>reading them because of my experience reading many different rules and<br>playing many different games.  I can imagine the game and "play" it (in my<br>head) to get a feel for it.  Even so, I like to really play the game against<br>someone else to really learn something about it.<br><br>Simon Dorfman<br><br>On Wed, Feb 24, 2010 at 9:38 AM, mark_steere <mark_steere@...> wrote:<br><br>><br>><br>> A good set of rules is more than an unstruck cup.
