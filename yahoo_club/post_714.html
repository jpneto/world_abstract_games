    <div>Hi Ralf,<br><br>One further comment:<br><br>>While I suggested in our forum that the taxonomy <br>>of games should be based exclusively on their goals, <br>>which can be critisized as too simplistic, Browne <br>>tried a far more comprehensive approach by taking <br>>into account the full characteristics of a game. <br><br>A couple of people have questioned the importance of "connective <br>play" in determining whether a game is a connection game. This is a <br>much more elusive quality to pin down than "connective goal", but I <br>believe that it sheds a great deal of light on the basic nature of <br>some games. Star is a prime example oof thisa much more concrete <br>example.<br><br>Anyone familiar with Star will probably have little hesitation in <br>stating that it is clearly a connection game, yet the goal of the <br>game is to score points; the goal is a by-product of connection, not <br>a specific connection itself. <br><br>This is what is meant by connection being either a means or an end <br>to a game (p69). In this case it is the means (connective play).<br><br>Go is a weaker example. Connection is the means (surrounding pieces <br>and enclosing territory) but not exactly the end of the game. Again, <br>the goal is a by-product of connection.<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron</div>
