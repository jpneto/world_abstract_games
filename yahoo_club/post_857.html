    <div>Thank you for your comments, Maurizio.  I would like to read Mark <br>Thompson's article if you can provide a link for that. <br>Coincidentally I'm currently playing Mark Thompson in a game of Byte <br>at superdupergames.org, so I can always ask him.  But others in the <br>group might be interested to know.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "megamau_2000" <madeleo@t...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> I agree with something you said, but not with all.

It may be BORING (worst problem), too fiddly (think of many<br>> grand variations of chess) or lack in some of the quality <br>described by<br>> Mark Thompson in his famous article (clarity, depth, <br>decisivenes...)<br>> and the list doesn't stop here.<br>> However I agree that the one you mention are common flaws of games.<br>> <br>> <br>> > Why are these characteristics such a problem?

But again, the more<br>> > expert players become, the more frequently ties will occur.<br>> <br>> As a checkers player, I agree that drawn-out (pun unintended) draws<br>> can be very boring. However if the players are of similar skill <br>they<br>> usually realize at similar times that the game is a draw. Before <br>that<br>> the game is still very exciting, with one side trying to "squeeze <br>out"<br>> an half point, and the other trying to defend.<br>> I don't see ties as a big problem. If two players played at the <br>same<br>> level, a tie is the most appropriate result. Of course ties should<br>> rarely happen, but they don't constitute a big problem. Sometime I<br>> think that the komi in GO should be integer rather than <br>fractional. <br>> <br>> > My first game, Quadrature, was infinite (subject to draw <br>cycles).  <br>> > My next three games, Tanbo, Impasse, and Byte were finite and <br>> > conclusive (no ties).

No game is perfect, but some <br>are<br>> > much more resistant to first move advantage than others.  <br>> <br>> Actually EVERY perfect information game which is finite and <br>conclusive<br>> (no draw and no ties) MUST HAVE either first or second move <br>advantage.<br>> With perfect play one of the two players must win. The only <br>difference<br>> between games is how much this advantage is PERCEIVED by reasonably<br>> skilled players. <br>> <br>> > For example, Hex is finite and conclusive, but has a strong<br>> > first move advantage, even among beginners.  Someone invariably <br>> > mentions the "pie" or "swapping" rule.

Go without Komi has a first player advantage only <br>slightly<br>> less noticeable. Go with komi has either a first or second player<br>> advantage, but that is almost impossible to notice (and in fact we<br>> don't know what is the correct komi).<br>> Hex with swap has a second move advantage (second player can always<br>> win). However this is much much less noticeable than the first move<br>> advantage of regular Hex. Games of Hex with swap are usually very<br>> balanced and enjoyable. As I already said EVERY perfect information<br>> finite and decisive game must have first (or second) move <br>advantage,<br>> including Tanbo and Byte. However for Tanbo,Byte AND swap Hex this <br>is<br>> not easily noticeable.<br>> <br>> > In any case, the pie rule diminishes the elegance of set of<br>> > rules that would be simpler without it.<br>> <br>> I don't agree. Any game could have a simpler set of rules if you<br>> remove some of them. What counts is the total complexity of the <br>game.<br>> Hex with the swap rule can be explained to (and can be understood <br>by)<br>> the average Joe in less than two minutes. I don't think there are <br>many<br>> others game with such a simplicity. <br>> <br>> > I've brought up this discussion before in other forums.

Other games <br>which<br>> have these characteristics are *Star, Pylos, Fire and Ice. Those <br>are<br>> just the first ones that I noticed with a quick scan of my <br>collection,<br>> but I am sure there are others. Before anybody tells me that they <br>have<br>> a fist (or second) move advantage, I will repeat that everything is<br>> about perceived advantage....because an actual advantage MUST be<br>> there. I am no expert player of any of them, but I didn't notice <br>any<br>> strong bias toward the first or second player.<br>> <br>> <br>> > And then someone may angrily demand to know, "Who cares <br>anyway!?"

What's the problem?<br>> ><br>> > Mark Steere<br>> <br>> I agree that we should care about these qualities of an abstract<br>> games. However you are mistaken if you think that these are the <br>only<br>> ones that matter or that no game can be excellent without them.<br>> Chess, Shogi, Twixt and a multitude of others games have proven to <br>be<br>> excellent even if they aren't decisive or there is a first move <br>advantage.<br>> <br>> Maurizio<br>></div>
