    <div>Hi Ji!<br><br>>add to the usual stones a fix<br>number of stones of life. <br><br>In fact, this was<br>already be done. I call it the Diplomat on my Go website<br>(in the Other Pieces section)<br><br>There is also a<br>variant where the weaker player has a special life stone<br>that may be used anytime. I read somewhere that its<br>value reaches 5 handicap stones if well<br>played.<br><br>>Stones of life in this variant would be two sided so<br>that when captured <br>>becomes a stone of life for<br>the opponent. <br><br>hmmm... but the stone of life<br>can be captured? Doesn't it give life to<br>itself?<br><br>>For a 19x19 board, I would say 4 stones of life per<br>player at the start of the game. <br><br>That is<br>probably too much, as you see by the value of one single<br>stone. Perhaps that would make living groups to easy to<br>make.<br> <br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
