    <div>Some people do feel that players should not use that kind of drawish <br>strategy when playing games (any game). But if a game is sensible to <br>that type of problem, I agree with Cam, the rules need more work. It <br>is easy to blame a player, but it is more productive to fix the game.<br><br>In some cases that is easy: in Halma just change the goal a bit <br>(check Halma's webpage at WAG). Others, like Abalone which tends to <br>favor a defensive play may be a little harder (it seems that <br>starting in a different initial setup may solve the problem). But <br>when a game has an obvious drawish strategy that is not easily <br>solved (i.e., without changing the game's initial purpose), to me, <br>it is the same as having an obvious winning strategy. In other <br>words, it is a bad game.<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
