    <div>Rich, calm down.  The problems you're experiencing with IAGO are not a<br>result of my "whining".  They're a result of fundamental flaws in your<br>approach.  In a nutshell: Inclusiveness + Misrepresentation =3D Misguided.<br><br>Abstract games are very exclusive.  Some people view them as the<br>highest, most elegant form of game.  Just speaking for myself, I don't<br>want to see them lumped in with the likes of Poker.  Your goal is to<br>popularize abstract games.  Great!  A very noble endeavor.  But you're<br> sabotaging yourself with your misguided approach.  <br><br>First mistake: Inclusiveness.  You want to lump abstract games<br>together with every game under the sun, from Chess to Backgammon to<br>Poker to Pin the Tail on the Donkey.  Just that much alone is a major<br>flaw.<br><br>Second mistake: Misrepresentation. You're actually attempting to<br>redefine the term abstract game with your IAR system to include every<br>imaginable game as a "non-standard abstract game".  <br><br>What this adds up to: Misguided.  It's like you're opening what<br>appears to be a classy restaurant but when you look at the menu<br>there's a variety of microwave burritos alongside the filet mignon and<br>expensive wines.  And you explain to the incredulous customers that<br>microwave burritos are actually "non-standard" classy food.  And the<br>pinball machines are "non-standard" classy entertainment.<br><br>As you can see, people aren't flocking to help you reshape the field<br>of abstract games into your warped vision.  You dismiss a strict<br>definition of abstract games as being for "purists", this weird group<br>of people who believe in precise, accurate definitions.  <br><br>Really the whole root of the problem is simply a semantic<br>contradiction.  You want to call your organization an abstract game<br>organization but then cover all games.  You have two simple choices:<br>either deal with abstract games only, in some narrow, strictly defined<br>sense, such as the so-called CGT definition, or change the name of<br>your organization to something more general like Mind Games<br>International.  You're only fooling yourself with this "non-standard<br>abstract games" nonsense.  Nobody with a shred of sanity is going to<br>buy into that, never mind help you perpetrate such a hoax.<br><br>As I explained to you earlier, many people have tried to politely reel<br>you in to planet Earth but this just seems to make you even more<br>combative.<br><br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Mark, you have said the following:<br>> http://abstractgamers.org/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3D145&page=3D1<br>> <br>> You're damaging abstract games with all this "non-standard" abstract<br>> games nonsense.<br>> <br>> This "standard" and "non-standard" were consolidation points to your<br>> whining.  As far as I am concern, the ONLY think you have contributed<br>> to IAGO is the rules length criterion in the IAR, which actually<br>> people don't like.  You gave some feedback on the front banner, but as<br>> far as functioning, all you have contributed is whining.<br>> <br>> I have laid out several things you could do here, but you insist on<br>> whining, and picking up your blocks and storming off, like a child,<br>> and not helping.  Even now, you end up say, "I didn't say RUIN, I said<br>> DAMAGE".  It is all about Mark Steere, and not much else.  Multiple<br>> olive branches have been extended here to you, and I have gone above<br>> and beyond what is called for, but you still go ahead and act like a<br>> child here Mark. <br>> <br>> Anyhow, if anyone else wants to help here, please do.  The idea here<br>> is to advance things.  If anyone wants to help, please do. Make the<br>> zero IAR rating meaningful, so if you are a combinatorial purist, you<br>> can at least get SOMETHING.<br>> <br>> Mark, you are the one who is going to cause more harm, by insisting<br>> things remain in the back alleys of the Internet here.  Your stubborn<br>> refusal to be constructive is more of an issue here than anything else.<br>> <br>> Ok, I will let you win this one.  You said "damage", instead of "ruin"<br>> and also said "more harm than good".  Ok, you win Mark.  Why not throw<br>> a little party for yourself and you small little world?<br>> <br>> Beyond this, if anyone is interested in promoting combinatorial game<br>> theory games, please get involved with IAGO and make sure they are<br>> emphasized sufficiently that they don't get shorted.  Despite what<br>> other people think, IAGO is looking to promote these games also.<br>> <br>> And I am sorry for any possible issues here that may of arisen that<br>> are annoying for people.<br>> <br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@><br>> wrote:<br>> <br>> > I never said IAGO was going to "ruin" the definition of abstract game.<br>> >  Plastering that claim all over the Internet won't make it true.
