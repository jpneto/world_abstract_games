    <div>Boardspace.net has just added it's 8'th game, Gobblet.<br><br> Gobblet is a deceptively simple game, played on a 4x4 board.<br>The goal of the game is to make four in a row, but the pieces<br>are "gobblets" that nest like Russian dolls.<br><br> There's a kick-ass robot player to show you the ropes.</div>
