    <div>Responding to a message posted in true-stacking-games <br>entitled, "What Byte has in common with Yinsh" by Ralf Gering.  (I <br>intended to cross post to both groups but apparently I was banned <br>from true-stacking-games after questioning the vile denigration of <br>Christian Freeling.  Such derision of a revered game inventor has no <br>place in a game discussion group.)<br><br>A quote from the Byte/Yinsh memo: <br><br>"A general observation is that there are a lot of moves to choose <br>from in the opening (>60), but the number of choices a player has is <br>soon rapidly diminishing.<br><br>If we consider these limitations, the number of legal board positions<br>can't be that large. I suppose that state-of-the-art computers could <br>be able to calculate the game-theoretic values of all board <br>positions.<br><br>- Ralf"<br><br>The game tree of (10x10) Byte is *huge*.  The first four moves can <br>be played out 14 million different ways.  There are 384 locations a <br>checker can be moved to in international Byte, compared with the 361 <br>of Go.<br><br>Another quote:<br><br>"Both games could be called N-in-a-Row Games: The rows are in Byte<br>vertical, in other words, they are stacks of height 8. In both games<br>you must complete more than one row in order to win.<br><br>- Ralf"<br><br>That's absurd.  "In-a-row" implies that you form a line of your own <br>pieces.  This does not happen in Byte in the horizontal or vertical <br>directions.<br><br>Advice for would be analyzers of Byte: Yes, you can make <br>observations about a game without actually playing it.  But if you <br>really want to get into it and comment on strategy and first <br>move/second move advantage, etc., you need to *actually play* the <br>game - against *other people* - people who hopefully have developed <br>some level of skill in the game.  Armchair "analysis" is no <br>substitute for playing, in most cases, if you really want to <br>understand a game.<br><br>Ralf's "observations" are clearly the musings of someone who has <br>never actually played Byte, and which are therefore uninformed, <br>misguided, and relatively useless.  I understand that it's easy to <br>scratch up some Byte play at superdupergames.org, and that Ralf or <br>anybody else who would like to actually play would be welcome there.<br><br>Preston</div>
