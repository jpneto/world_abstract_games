    <div>> A stone or a fraction of stone is *living*<br>if and only if it is<br>> adjacent to an empty<br>spot or to a smaller opposite fraction or to<br>> a<br>living ***smaller*** friendly fraction.<br><br>No, it<br>cannot be so! The middle half stone in your first<br>example<br>would be immediately dead even when its surrounding<br>friends are<br>alive. We don't want that<br>either.<br><br>> __ _x __<br>> _x _x _x<br>> __ _x<br>__<br><br>The only trouble you point out in my definition is<br>the infinite<br>recursion. I am implicitly using the<br>convention that a fraction<br>is living if and only if you<br>can reach the conclusion that it is<br>living through<br>the definition. You are not supposed to think<br>that<br>"living" may have another meaning. If you really cannot<br>reach any<br>conclusion, the fraction isn't living.<br>Like a Turing Machine that<br>would accept its input<br>when and only when it is a living fraction<br>- if the<br>Turing Machine never halts, then the input<br>isn't<br>accepted and the fraction is said not to be<br>living.<br><br>Anyway, it looks like I wasn't clear so here is<br>another<br>definition that makes it explicit with geometric<br>concepts<br>(through the word "reaches"):<br><br> A stone or a<br>fraction of stone is *living* if and only if there<br> is<br>some path from it on the adjacency grid that reaches<br>an empty<br> intersection or a smaller opposing<br>fraction and that goes only<br> through intermediate<br>intersections occupied by friendly<br> fractions.<br><br>Claude<br>Chaunier</div>
