    <div>Dear Clark,<br><br>>Ralf, I recently acquired copies of both Qubic and Tricolor, and I<br>>would be interested in what you had to say about them.<br><br>There are Qubic tournaments and even kind of a club in Germany. Tricolor is <br>a very nice game. I would like to publish all my manuscripts in this group <br>if we knew 100% that AGM is dead (and will never resurrect from the dead.)<br><br>Ralf</div>
