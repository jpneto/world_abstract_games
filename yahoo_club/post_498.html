    <div>Hello,<br><br>I recently analyzed the Reversi-like connection games "Troll" and<br>"Gomullo". It appears that the first player has a huge advantage and<br>should win most if not all games. What are your experiences?<br><br>In Troll the best moves appear to be at the corners and then the edge,<br>similar to what happens in Yinsh openings when played by top players<br>in brettspielwelt.de (the new game of the Gipf project).<br><br>Ralf</div>
