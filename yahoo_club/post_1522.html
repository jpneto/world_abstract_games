    <div>A few years back, I picked up a copy of "New Rules for Clasic Games" by R. Wayne Schmittberger.  In one section he discusses how Chase games (Fox & Geese, Tablut, etc.) always have a built in disadvantage for one of the players.  This hardly makes for a satisfying game.  He offered a few suggestion for fixing this.  One is bidding.  Another is playing the game twice with the sides exchanged and counting the moves.  But the most interesting idea was to have two boards and play two games simultaneously, with the players' roles reversed on the second board.  The player who first meets their objective on either board is the winner. <br><br>I thought this was an intriguing idea.  I'm surprised I've never come across any attempt to implement it.  Tafl is the richest of the Chase games so I decided to make a double board version of that.  I called it "Shields & Swords":<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/42480?do=3Dshow;id=3D1691<br><br>Chinese Rebles is another chase game.  But is rather simplistic and belongs more as a children's game.  Honestly, the only reason I decided to make a double board version of it was the idea that with a slight modification to the rules, I could create a double board with one common space that was a goal for both sides.  I named it "Chinese Civil War"<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/42470?do=3Dshow;id=3D1688</div>
