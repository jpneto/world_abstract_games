    <div>I guess you're right, I must have missed something. <br>It's one of the  best one-dimensional games I know. <br>There is only one sad thing: the games are rather<br>short. It should be possible to solve the game <br>by brute-force.<br><br>TruthForum<br><br>> Hmm, are you positive you're not missing some captures? Lynn Smith <br>> has now completed a ZRF that plays the game, and says he's played it <br>> for hours against the machine with only one draw (by repetition) and <br>> no stale games.</div>
