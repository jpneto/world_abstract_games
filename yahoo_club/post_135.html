    <div>Hi Miss V,<br><br>One thing you could check is<br><a href=http://www.gamingdumpster.com/wgd/ target=new>http://www.gamingdumpster.com/wgd/</a> . That's a "world gamers database" where people<br>can go and enter themselves by location and gaming<br>interests, with an e-mail link. Then other people can find<br>them and make contact. It sounds like a good idea but<br>I don't know how well it works. I just took a look<br>and found there is one person listed in Winchester,<br>VA.<br><br>Then there are clubs connected with particular games,<br>like the U.S. Chess Federation<br>(<a href=http://www.uschess.org/ target=new>http://www.uschess.org/</a>) or the American Contract Bridge League<br>(<a href=http://www.acbl.org/ target=new>http://www.acbl.org/</a>), and many others. Some of them have listings of<br>local clubs on their websites.<br><br>Good luck with<br>everything! Maybe other people will also have<br>suggestions.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br>Chicago, IL</div>
