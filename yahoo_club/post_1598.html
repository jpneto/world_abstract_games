    <div>New MSG game: Mosaic<br><br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Mosaic_rules.pdf<br><br>Mosaic is a game of territory and aggression.  Reversi tiles are played on a hex hex board.  Multiple flip sequences sometimes occur in one turn.  Interestingly, a number of flips may occur after the board has completely filled with tiles, though of course Mosaic is a naturally finite game.<br><br>I've been playing Mosaic for several days and it's shaping up to be a very interesting game.  <br><br>Mosaic can be played at gwc:<br><br>  http://games.wtanaka.com/<br><br>Do me a favor.
