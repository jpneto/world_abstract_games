    <div>> Not to be a nitpicker, Maurizio, but Star and especially Fire and <br>> Ice seem to share Hex's vulnerability to first move advantage.  <br><br>No problem. I like precision, so I don't give a negative connotation<br>to nitpicking. Star and *Star (pronunced "starstar") are actually two<br>(slightly) different games. I never played the former, so I don't have<br>an opinion on it.<br>I consider *Star, on the other hand, to be only weakly influenced by<br>first move. There is a central position which can be used by both<br>players for connection, and this dramatically reduces the advantage of<br>claiming the center first. Of course having "sente" helps, but I would<br>compare *Star to Go without komi: on average black is advantaged, but<br>the great great majority of times who played better (also slightly)<br>wins regardless of starting order. If I were to estimate a Komi for<br>the 51-points *Star board it would be something like 3.<br>Of course take everything I said with a grain of salt, because I<br>played *Star less than 10 times.<br>Regarding "Fire and Ice", I played the "Abstracta Marathon" e-mail<br>tournament with good results (I had to forfeit from the final group<br>due to lack of time). I didn't notice a great first player advantage,<br>altough some other players tought it was there. Somebody also proposed<br>a variant for solving this "problem". If I recall correctly it<br>consisted in awarding Ice (the second player) a double move to be<br>performed at his choice, but only once in the whole game. <br><br>> Pylos - and I have only read a brief description - but the fact that <br>> you can put one ball on and immediately take one or two off - I am <br>> not yet convinced that this game is finite.<br><br>I agree. I was just scanning through my collection and I noticed that<br>Pylos is decisive (no ties) but I didn't think about the fact that is<br>not finite (there can be "draws").<br><br>Maurizio</div>
