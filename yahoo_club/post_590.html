    <div>Dear Dan,<br><br>Thank you much for pointing me at the following website:<br><br>http://www.aardwolfgames.com/rules/swahili/index.pdf<br>http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Swahili.PDF<br><br><br><br>I already tried the game and find it truly amazing. <br><br>Even the two-person variant is quite playable. At first I thought the <br>second player could simply imitate the moves of the first player, <br>until I realized that the first player would win by 10 points. The <br>second player changed his tactics and did a move of which he thought <br>it would loose the game. But the second player won by 20 points!<br><br>The four-person variant is even more fun. Probably the two players <br>which sit across should form a team to prevent unfair coalitions. <br>There are only very few abstract games for four players which I <br>enjoy: Schachmati Kreposti, Vierschach, Pair Go, Blokus for two <br>Teams, and now Swahili.<br><br>I am still looking for the rules of "Pass it on".<br><br>BTW, everybody should try Dan's Cross-Wari (rules at Zillions). It is <br>one of the best Mancala variants ever invented.<br><br>Have fun,<br><br>Ralf</div>
