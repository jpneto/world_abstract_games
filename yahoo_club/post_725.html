    <div>> I don't think this rule exists in Pool Checkers.<br><br>You're right. I checked other sources too. I rewrote the checkers <br>webpage.<br> <br>> BTW, if somebody would write "Black starts a game of Chess", I <br>would <br>> consider these rules as wrong and the whole source as not reliable <br>> (whether the "nature" of the game is affected or not). <br><br>I understand and respect your position. However, if I try to <br>abstract Chess, I would say that colors are irrelevant, names are <br>irrelevant, colored squares are irrelevant and even if mirror the <br>board, the game is the same. I would like to imagine that somebody <br>did that to Go in the distant past :-)<br><br>History is important. To better understand the game's origins and <br>connections to other games, what was on the inventor's mind, and so <br>on... But it is mathematically irrelevant.<br><br>One of my wishes is a concise specification language for abstract <br>games (Zillions' ZRF was a huge step but I believe it's possible to <br>do better) so that a game could be presented without any ambiguity, <br>and 'naked', ie, without historical background and visual cosmetics. <br><br>Joao</div>
