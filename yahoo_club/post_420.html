    <div>Hello!<br><br>First a little bit of history. "The Bridge" is now called<br>"=C9coute-moi!" (French for "Listen to me!"), out of solidarity with<br>France, after the hostile American policy against the French Republic<br>(and Monsieur Chirac who didn't need to steal an election to become<br>president) and after "French Fries" have been renamed in "Freedom<br>Fries" by the US Congress. I invented the game in the night before All<br>Saints in 2002 in Kusterdingen, Southern Germany.<br><br>If you want to play this game, you first need to learn French, because<br>moves are "negotiated" in French. The language is part of the rules.<br><br>=C9coute-moi! is played on a square board, numbering 13x13=3D169<br>uncheckered squares.<br>At the start of the game, there is a white stone (draughts man) in the<br>centre, called "Coureur" ("Runner"). The players own a sufficient<br>large number of black Go stones.<br><br>The upper and lower side of the board is owned by White, the left and<br>right side by Black. Corner squares belong to both players. The lower<br>right and upper left corner is marked by a "-" called "Negative", the<br>lower left and upper right corner is marked with "+" called "Positive".<br><br>White starts.<br><br>Each move consists of three "actions":<br><br>a. "Annoncer" ("Announce"): One player names first either the number<br>"un" ("one") or "deux" ("two") and then either "Blanc" ("White"),<br>"Noir" ("Black"), "Negative" ("negative") or "Positive" ("positive").<br>Take care that your pronounciation is good - this is not English, it<br>is French! The digit determines the extent, the colour or charge<br>determines the direction of the moves which are carried out during the<br>two following "actions". You can say, for instance: "Deux Noir!" (but<br>NOT: "Un Noir, negative!")<br><br>b. "Mouvement" ("Movement"): Now the other player moves the "Coureur"<br>one or three squares, if "Un" was annonced, he moves him exactly two<br>squares, if "Deux" was announced. He moves straight towards one of the<br>black sides, if "Noir" was announced, straight towards one of the<br>White sides if "Blanc" was announced.  The "Coureur" moves in the<br>direction of the positive diagonal, if "Positive" was announced, or in<br>the direction of the negative diagonal, if "Negative" was announced <br><br>c. "Mouvement Compl=E9mentaire" ("Complimentary Movement"): Now, the<br>player, who announced, moves in the reversed manner. If the "coureur"<br>was moved one square, he is now moved three. Was he moved three<br>squares, he is now moved only one. Was he moved two squares, he is now<br>moved exactly two squares again. Instead of "Blanc" he now moves<br>"Noir" (and vice versa). Instead of "Positive" he now moves "Negative"<br>(and vice versa).<br><br>After each movement a black stone is put on the last square crossed. <br><br>You are neither permitted to move on occupied squares, nor cross them.<br><br>After all three "actions" are carried out, the cycle starts anew.<br><br>If a move cannot be done, because the "Coureur" is blocked, the<br>"coureur" can and must be put first on a square from where the move<br>can be carried out. <br><br>You must move, you may not pass. Each "action" is considered to be a move.<br><br>Capturing is not possible.<br><br>Winner: The first player who connects his two sides with a chain of<br>orthogonally or diagonally adjacent black stones ("coureur" doesn't<br>count).<br><br>Point Scoring: The winner gets as many points as the looser still<br>needs stones to connect his sides. If in an action all sides are<br>connected simultaneously, the player who placed the last stone wins by<br>a half point.<br><br>A draw is not possible.<br><br>A final rule:<br><br>Players are compelled to speak French during the game. Any other<br>language is strictly forbidden. Use of it will result in the immediate<br>loss of the game. A player may say (for instance): "Un positive, s'il<br>vous pla=EEt!"<br><br>(C) 2003, Ralf Gering (Bad Breisig, Germany)<br><br>Ralf</div>
