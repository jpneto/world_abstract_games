    <div>Why wouldn't it be an abstract strategy game?  The anchor point for an<br>abstract strategy game, by IAGO standards, is 2 player combinatorial<br>game theory games.  There is allowance for some deviation, but that is<br>the center point.  I don't see where Chesimals has any imperfect<br>information or random elements of any sort.  So, not sure why it wouldn't.<br><br>What had happened with "theming" or "chrome" was discussed, is that it<br>didn't have a quantifiable criterion.  It had been put in the<br>criterion for evaluation via excluding games if they were any other<br>genre, and also in rules length.  <br><br>All and all, I don't see why it wouldn't be.  You start throwing in<br>stuff that causes rules bloat for theming reasons, then you deviate<br>from abstract strategy games.<br><br>That is my 2 cents on it.</div>
