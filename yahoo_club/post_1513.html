    <div>Simultaneous Connect Four by Richard Hutnik (copyright 2009)<br><br>Introduction:<br>This is Simultaneous Connect Four.  It is simultaneous, because both<br>players select their moves simultaneously, then resolve.  <br><br>The origins of this game came out of a project to develop a way to<br>play abstract strategy games with large numbers of people playing in a<br>crowd.  Connect 4 was selected as the base game to get the massive<br>multiplayer framework to work.  The end result is an interesting take<br>on Connect Four that turns what it seen as a simple children's game<br>into a game that is a bit of war of nerves with additional depth,<br>eventhough it stops being a pure abstract strategy game in the process.<br><br>Equipment:<br>* Standard Connect Four Set.<br>* Two sets of cards (numbered 1-7), each number having one of these<br>numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  An 8 sided die may be used, with 8<br>being no option, or 6 sided.  Each player would have one.<br>* Two sets of stickers to mark each column 1-7.  <br>* Initiative token.  This token is used for tie-breaking purposes in<br>the event both players select the same column.  An item that stands<br>out and is small enough to pass from player to player, can be used.<br><br>Preparation of Equipment for Play:<br>* Each side has stickers placed on it, either Each column is marked on<br>both sides with the same number on both sides for each column.  One<br>side has numbers go from left to right from 1 to 7 incrementally by 1,<br>while the other side goes from left to right 7 to 1, decrementally by 1.<br><br>Set Up:<br>1. Separate piles of cards 1-7 into two even piles.  Give each set of<br>cards to each player.  These cards are used to select moves.<br>2. Determine which player will start with the initiative token.  This<br>can be done randomly or by some other method.<br><br>Rules:<br>1. Players at the same time select which column they want to drop a<br>checker into.  This process is done simultaneously and is hidden.  If<br>using cards, one suggestion is to put the selection at the bottom of<br>the hand of cards players have.  <br>2. Players then reveal which column they selected.<br>3. If the players selected different columns then players drop their<br>checkers into their own column, and go onto next turn.<br>4. If players both select the same column, then the player who has the<br>initiative token would place their checker first, and their opponent<br>would then place after them, and the initiative token is then passed<br>to the opponent, who then now has the initiative token.<br>5. If, when players simultaneously pick the same column, and the first<br>player places their checker in the last open space in a column, then<br>the second player forfeits the ability to place a checker during that<br>turn.  However, eventhough they forfeited the chance to place a<br>checker, they still gain control of the initiative token.<br><br>Winning the Game:<br>1. First player to get four in a row wins the game.  In the case that<br>both players win at the same time, the player with the initiative<br>token wins.<br><br>Variants:<br>1. As an intro game, use only columns 1-6.  Block off column 7.  This<br>gives people a good feel for the game before playing the full way. <br>This version is proposed so that players can get used to the game, and<br>also eliminate the middle column advantage found in the normal game. <br>This is how the game was originally intended to be played, but people<br>felt that the simultaneous element eliminated the first player<br>advantage that is gained by playing in column 4.  Also, you can play<br>this version using six sided dice as selectors.<br>2. Dice may be used instead of cards, if this is what players have<br>available. Six or 8 sided are recommended.  Players would conceal what<br>they select as their move, and the put the facing representing the<br>column they want to select, and then reveal.<br>3. In the case that both players win at same time, the player who<br>DOESN'T have the initiative token wins the game.  This is a flipping<br>of the normal conditions to resolve simultaneous wins.</div>
