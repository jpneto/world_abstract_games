    <div>Ddyer and Aaron,<br><br>It's nice to see people working on gaming websites for abstract games. <br>It is not that easy to find time and effort to develop stuff that most <br>do not care about. A big thanks for that!<br><br>What about if each site creates a tournament based on a chosen game? <br>People could join to play the tournament and get to know both <br>websites. Of course, if any of you likes the idea, games should only <br>start at Setember (we're in the middle of the silly season :)<br><br>Cheers, Joao Neto</div>
