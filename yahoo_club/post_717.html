    <div>> Using this definition, then Tic-Tac-Toe would also be a connection <br>> game, as every winning line connects two sides of the board.<br><br>In fact, funny :-)<br><br>> > "pattern-based" or "topological".<br>> <br>> The difference is that patterns are precise placements of pieces in <br>> relation to each other, whereas connections are "topologically <br>> invariant" in Kerry Handscomb's terms.<br><br>It appears that the boundary dividing topological games runs between <br>fixed patterns versus variable patterns (both common terms) and that <br>you actually wrote a book on variable pattern games.  (BTW, Cyclo <br>appears to be a "connection game" according to your defintion -- <br>rules given by Joao Neto)<br><br>> I would say that the goal of Star involves more than just making <br>> connections. In all the "pure" connection games, the game ends as <br>> soon as one player achieves the necessary connection(s). In Star, <br>> the game continues beyond this point regardless of how many <br>> connections are made, until the board is full or there is a clear <br>> winner - it is the quality of the connection that counts, not the <br>> mere fact of connection.<br><br>What you wrote first, sounded a little bit like saying scoring goals <br>is not the object of soccer.<br><br>I think, a game can have either an absolute outcome (mate, <br>connection, reaching the opposite board edge, etc.) or a relative one <br>(capturing more stones, making more territory, making more valuable <br>connections).  This, however, has nothing to do with the goal itself, <br>it's rather an (structural or intrinsic) method to qualify the extent <br>of a victory / loss. BTW, many "absolute" games also permit to <br>qualify / measure the extent of a victory e.g. Salta, Sleeping Beauty <br>Draughts and my connection game =C9coute-moi (these rules omitted in <br>your book) by introducing a meta-rule about point-scoring. In my <br>experience it is possible to introduce a point scoring system in all <br>Draughts variants and probably in most connection games. Although <br>some games may have a structurally defined absolute outcome, most <br>players "feel" that they have won /lost by a smaller or larger <br>margin, so it might be quite "natural" to apply such meta-rules.<br><br>Ralf</div>
