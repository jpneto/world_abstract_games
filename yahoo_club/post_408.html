    <div>is it?<br><br>if you move the largest gobblet again, will you not uncover the smaller one beneath ?<br><br>MVH<br>RJ<br><br><br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: truthforum2001 <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Tuesday, March 25, 2003 11:06 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Gobblet<br><br><br>  Gobblet is a draw in perfect play. After each player has put his three<br>  largest gobblets on the board, no good player would continue to place<br>  the remaining smaller gobblets on the board because they would be<br>  captured immediately, in other words this would be a bad move. For<br>  that reason players continue to move the large gobblets for ever. <br><br>  RJG<br><br><br>        Yahoo!
