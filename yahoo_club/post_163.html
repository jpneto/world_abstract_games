    <div>Hi<br><br>I read once about a game (called Jumpin?) which was played<br>on a rectangular grid, with a setup similar to this one:<br><br>o o o o o o <br>o o o o o o <br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>. . . . . .<br>x x x x x x<br>x x x x x x<br><br>(I believe it was 6 by 11, but I may be wrong)<br><br>All stones had long jumps capability, and they could also jump <br>lines of 2+ stones (of either/mixed color) at one time, landing on <br>the next adjacent stone. After a jump, the stone could continue<br>to jump. There were no captures <br><br>The goal was to reach the opponent setup zone.<br><br>But something is missing on this game (e.g., how can I force the<br>opponent to get out of his own cells? perhaps jumps were <br>mandatory...)<br><br>Does anybody know this game?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
