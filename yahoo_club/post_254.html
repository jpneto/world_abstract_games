    <div>Hello TruthForum,<br><br>The games are a bit hard to explain without diagrams, but I'll give <br>it a try.  If you have any questions, please let me know.<br><br>Steve<br><br>TRELLIS (standard version)<br><br>1.  The board is a 15x15 checkered grid (counting the points rather <br>than the squares).  The upper left square is a dark square.  The <br>board begins empty, and play takes place on the points.<br>2.  The pie rule governs the beginning of the game.<br>3.  The object of the game is Hex-like.  Black tries to connect the <br>top and bottom sides, and White tries to connect the left and right <br>sides.  A corner point is considered to belong to both sides that <br>meet there.<br>4.  On your turn you play two stones, which must be exactly three <br>points apart, in either an L-shape (i.e., the knight's relation) or <br>in a straight line.<br>5.  It is permissible to play just one stone, and it is permissible <br>to pass.<br>6.  Two same-color stones are considered to be connected if they're <br>orthogonally adjacent, or if they're diagonally adjacent over a "home <br>square."  Black's home squares are the dark squares, and White's home <br>squares are the light squares.<br><br>ORBIT (standard version)<br><br>1.  The board is a 16x16 grid (counting the points rather than the <br>squares).  The board begins empty, and play takes place on the points.<br>2.  The pie rule governs the beginning of the game.<br>3.  The object of the game is Go-like.  (It is often the case, <br>however, that territory need not be counted --- one player will <br>usually succeed in forming a giant, essentially game-winning "half-<br>orbit.")<br>4.  On your turn you play a stone.  It is permissible to pass your <br>turn.  When both players pass in succession, the game concludes.<br>5.  Two same-color stones are considered to be connected (i.e., as <br>belonging to the same group) if they're orthogonally adjacent or if <br>they're diagonally adjacent.<br>6.  An "orbit" is a connected group which completely encircles one or <br>more points of the board.  When an orbit is formed, any opposing <br>stones within the orbit are removed from the board, and it is <br>thereafter prohibited for the opponent to play within that orbit.<br>7.  A "half-orbit" is a connected group which, together with one side <br>of the board, completely encircles one or more points of the board.  <br>When a half-orbit is formed, it is thereafter prohibited for the <br>opponent to play within that half-orbit.<br><br>(Note: rules 6 and 7 can be summed up as "orbits capture and <br>prohibit, half-orbits prohibit.")<br><br>8.  At the end of the game, any stones that cannot avoid capture are <br>automatically removed from the board.<br>9.  It's possible for there to be shared territory (points where both <br>players are prohibited from playing).<br>10.  Your score is simply your own territory.  Captured pieces do not <br>count extra.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@y..., "truthforum2001" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>> What are the rules of Trellis and Orbit?<br>> <br>> > URL is http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/home.htm.
