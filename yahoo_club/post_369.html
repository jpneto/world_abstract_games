    <div>By the way, I'm going to "host" a Quoridor tournament on Richard's <br>play-by-email server starting early in January. This is a free and <br>easy-to-use server, so even if you're not yet a user I hope you'll <br>sign on and join the tournament if you're a Quoridor fan. <br><br>Play is by e-mail through the server, with 30 days to complete all <br>your moves. So far there are about 15 players, and the limit is 20. <br>It will be organized into two (maybe 3) rounds of round-robin play, <br>about 4 or 5 players per round. If there are lots of ties in round 1 <br>then there might be two rounds in round 2, hence a third round of the <br>winners for a play-off. The final champion wins a new, shrink-wrapped <br>Quoridor set.<br><br>To join the tournament, sign up at Richard's and message me. My user <br>id there is markthomps.</div>
