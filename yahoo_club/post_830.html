    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>> What is a Stacking Game?<br>> <br>> There are many games in which pieces are put on each other or <br>> which have pieces on the same board position. [...] stacking isn't <br>> an essential feature of Draughts. "Kings" should be called "pseudo-<br>> stacks". They pretend to be stacks, but in fact they are not.<br><br>I agree. There is a difference between games that can be played with <br>stackable material and true stack games. Draughts is one example of <br>the first case and there are many others, like Ralf said.<br><br>>You can play every Chess variant including FIDE Chess just by <br>>ascribing each piece a stack of a defined height, thus turning <br>>Chess into a "stacking game".<br><br>True. But the main argument would be that these 'stacks' never <br>change their components *or* their size. They are totally fixed.<br><br>>There are many pseudo-stacking games, e.g. all Mancala variants <br>>(except Rondell), Backgammon, but also Abstract Chess (Joao Neto), <br>>UnStack (Joao Neto) and Tower of Power (Mike Baldwin). In all these<br>>games it doesn't matter whether the pieces are stacked or put side <br>>by side in an arbitrary way on the same board square. <br><br>Well, I also agree. But aren't you restricting a bit too much your <br>definition? Backgammon, AbChess and Tower of Power use stacks in a <br>different way than Draughts. Stacks on those games do change sizes <br>(even if they are homogenous in its composition).<br><br>We can use the reverse argument. Any game that uses stacks can be <br>transformed into a non-stack game. AbChess can be played with 3 or 4 <br>Chess sets. Backgammon can be played with 30 different pieces. But <br>also Byte can be translated into a game with a couple of sets of <br>2^8=3D256 different pieces. Of course, this translation isn't <br>practical but that is not the point.<br><br>The point is that some games have fixed pieces and others do not. <br>From these, some use homogenous stones and for others the stack's <br>structure is relevant to its definition (this one would be Ralf's <br>stacking games definition).<br><br>So I would guess we are talking about three different sets of games:<br>* Non-stack games<br>* Homogenous stack games<br>* Heterogeneous stack games<br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
