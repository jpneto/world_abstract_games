    <div>Mark,<br><br>Well there may be a silver lining (although perhaps a minor one) in all of <br>this.  When I first read the rules to Rush I thought it would be a good <br>test for Axiom so I programmed it (strictly for my own use of course). Now <br>that it's officially in the public domain, I can now make it available. <br>Mark - I'll plan on sending you a copy (this evening) for you to evaluate. <br> I put it together quickly so I really can't say how strong it is or <br>isn't.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br>P.S.  I see you've revised the rules to remove the former restrictions <br>that were in place.<br><br><br><br><br>"mark_steere" <mark_steere@...> <br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>02/15/2008 12:20 PM<br>Please respond to<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br>To<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>cc<br><br>Subject<br>[Abstract Games] The game of Rush now public domain<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>As some of you may recall, I released a game called Rush in May of<br>2007.
