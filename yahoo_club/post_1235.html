    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> Rich, calm down.  The problems you're experiencing with IAGO are not a<br>> result of my "whining".  They're a result of fundamental flaws in your<br>> approach.  In a nutshell: Inclusiveness + Misrepresentation =3D <br>> Misguided.<br><br>You are whining mark.  You have been given the label "troll" by<br>individuals who have read your posts.  And it is whining, because you<br>are basing your definitions around a single document written as a puff<br>piece (Mark Thompson, you called your document that.  It has gotten a<br>lot more mileage than even you have expected).<br> <br>> Abstract games are very exclusive.  Some people view them as the<br>> highest, most elegant form of game.  Just speaking for myself, I don't<br>> want to see them lumped in with the likes of Poker.  Your goal is to<br>> popularize abstract games.  Great!  A very noble endeavor.  But you're<br>>  sabotaging yourself with your misguided approach.  <br><br>Combinatorial game theory games are very exclusive.  Abstract STRATEGY<br> games is less exclusive by MOST people's definitions.  Abstract games<br>are even more exclusive.  The heart of abstract is lacking in theme. <br>IAGO also isn't lumping games in with poker.  There happens to be<br>people who play poker who would rather play chess, and for the chess<br>side to get noticed, a potential hybrid chess-poker tournament ON<br>TELEVISION may come about.  This does NOT mean that poker is a<br>qualified abstract strategy game.<br><br>The idea of association with every game is to get abstracts where they<br>aren't now.  It doesn't mean that these other games are what IAGO is<br>known for, but will joint partner with.  It is currently a THEORETICAL<br>approach to doing this that doesn't even have anything in the IAGO<br>World Tour at this point.  Goblets is in, because it is on Dave Dyer's<br>boardspace.net site.<br><br>> First mistake: Inclusiveness.  You want to lump abstract games<br>> together with every game under the sun, from Chess to Backgammon to<br>> Poker to Pin the Tail on the Donkey.  Just that much alone is a major<br>> flaw.<br><br>Mark, that is NOT happening.  Games like Chess, Backgammon,<br>Kriegspiel, Bughouse and Chess960 all have been argued to be in IAGO<br>as abstract strategy games.  Poker has not, and Pin the Tail on the<br>Donkey has not.  You apparently haven't been paying attention here<br>regarding this.  What I did say is that, on the other end of the<br>spectrum someone argued just about any game that isn't a sim is an<br>abstract game.  I saw this as folly also.  You seriously have misread<br>things here.  You have actually gotten so anal, you were arguing<br>against coin tosses even.  Your view has caused Checkers, as the<br>American Checker Federation plays it, to be excluded.  You have also<br>flat out argued against Chess960.  Your view, in your attempt to be<br>whatever works against the way the world of abstract strategy games<br>works today.  <br><br>> Second mistake: Misrepresentation. You're actually attempting to<br>> redefine the term abstract game with your IAR system to include <br>> every imaginable game as a "non-standard abstract game".  <br><br>The IAR is a modified version of Aaron's Rubrics.  Go ahead and<br>contact him and tell him that he is misrepresenting abstract strategy<br>games by it.  Tell him he is off base.  Go ahead and do it.  As of now<br>there is an acceptance process of a game into IAGO.  There is first<br>the list of games.  If a game is something else, it isn't in IAGO. <br>Then, there is the Mark Thompson criterion for acceptance, which<br>should be games with a ZERO IAR.  After this, then you look to the<br>IAR, and allow a degree of variance from it.  This is a compromise to<br>handle the bulk of reality here Mark, and how the real world works,<br>like checkers using the 3 move random opening, or Chess960, or<br>Bughouse, or Kriegspiel and Dark Chess.  Games that the world<br>considers abstract strategy games. Backgammon is in a grey area, but I<br>showed you the abstractstrategy site including Chebache on it.  Also<br>Boardgame Geek also. It, therefore, looks to be included.  <br><br>> What this adds up to: Misguided.  It's like you're opening what<br>> appears to be a classy restaurant but when you look at the menu<br>> there's a variety of microwave burritos alongside the filet mignon and<br>> expensive wines.  And you explain to the incredulous customers that<br>> microwave burritos are actually "non-standard" classy food.  And the<br>> pinball machines are "non-standard" classy entertainment.<br><br>Mark what IAGO covers is abstract strategy games, that is to hit the<br>core point what the world believes they are.  It looks to have at the<br>core combinatorial game theory games, which should have a zero IAR. <br>Actually, it is even more restrictive, because a zero IAR means two<br>players only, not even two teams.<br><br>> As you can see, people aren't flocking to help you reshape the field<br>> of abstract games into your warped vision.  You dismiss a strict<br>> definition of abstract games as being for "purists", this weird group<br>> of people who believe in precise, accurate definitions.  <br><br>Mark, there is no field of "abstract games".  There are combinatorial<br>games, and abstract strategy games, and abstract games tends to be the<br>shorthand version.  This is a very tiny niche that isn't doing much at<br>this point, and most people don't know exists.  What I have described,<br>and what IAGO deals with, is practical realities and compromises that<br>will need to be made here.  As I have said to you, if you dislike<br>IAGO, do something different.  You could do something like the<br>Abstract Strategy Society.<br><br>What IAGO looks to have is something, ANYTHING that will get greater<br>exposure for abstract strategy games.  That is its purpose.  It also<br>seeks to have combinatorial purists involved.<br><br>> Really the whole root of the problem is simply a semantic<br>> contradiction.  You want to call your organization an abstract game<br>> organization but then cover all games.  You have two simple choices:<br>> either deal with abstract games only, in some narrow, strictly defined<br>> sense, such as the so-called CGT definition, or change the name of<br>> your organization to something more general like Mind Games<br>> International.  You're only fooling yourself with this "non-standard<br>> abstract games" nonsense.  Nobody with a shred of sanity is going to<br>> buy into that, never mind help you perpetrate such a hoax.<br><br>As I read you more and more, I see a person who isn't going to do<br>anything, and is immensely trollish in language.  You are profanity<br>short of being a full-blown troll.  You haven't even tried to get an<br>association started at all here in the years you have been one earth,<br>and it appears IAGO is the only thing.  So, rather than try to do<br>anything, you whine.  You even whine now. <br><br>> As I explained to you earlier, many people have tried to politely reel<br>> you in to planet Earth but this just seems to make you even more<br>> combative.<br><br>You are the one who uses negative and abusive speech Mark, not I.  I<br>explain practical realities here.  You can spite yourself here, by<br>demanding your games have no part of IAGO.  Go ahead and do that, and<br>I will tell Dave Dyer and anyone else than no IAGO World Tour events<br>will carry your games.  Your games will be removed from the Master<br>List of Abstract Strategy games also, and unregistered them from the<br>official registered list.  You will be the only designer to have this<br>happen, by the way.  That is up to you.  Just say the word.  I will<br>make a news announcement that you want your games unregistered, and<br>tell the world you don't want any of your games involved with IAGO.  I<br>will also explain it is because you believe that your restrictive 2<br>player only version of combinatorial game theory games are the only<br>games IAGO MUST do.<br><br>All this is up to you.  If you don't have problems with it, things can<br>stay as they are, with Dave Dyer keeping Dipole in, as do the other<br>sites.  The reality here is, if it comes between choosing to accept<br>Mark Steere or the American Checker Federation and the games they<br>play, I need to go with the American Checker Federation.<br><br>It is up to you Mark.  Do you want your games pulled or not?</div>
