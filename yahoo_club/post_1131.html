    <div>I am seeing news now that a post-Olympic event in China, the World<br>Mind Sports Games, is set for China in 2008, after the Olympics. They<br>are looking to run Chess, Checkers, Go, Bridge and also Chinese Chess.<br>For info on this, check out here:<br>http://www.worldbridge.org/competitions/Calendar/files/WorldMindSportsGames2007.pdf<br><br>And here:<br>http://amsr.ru/en/530.htm<br><br>And also here:<br>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/crosswords/bridge/27card.html<br><br>If anyone wants to know why I am suggesting a partnering with the<br>likes of chess and go, it is so that eventually you will have Athlon<br>events and the modern abstracts will stand a chance to end up on the<br>world stage in a big way.<br><br>Check out the pdf file for more information.</div>
