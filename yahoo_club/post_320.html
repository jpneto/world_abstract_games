    <div>Hi<br><br>Firstly, as always, thanks for your comments<br><br>> First of all, the game has just two phases. What Joao calls Phase 1 <br>> and 2, is actually (logically and officially) one phase which <br>> consists of putting pieces on the board, one by one, first the <br>> Dvonn pieces, then the other pieces.<br><br>I just think it's a different phase, since DVONN pieces are special <br>ones. But the rules doesn't change on this point<br> <br>> "After each move, any stack not in contact with a DVONN piece is <br>> captured by the player that made the move.  A stack is in contact <br>> if it has a DVONN stone, or is adjacent to another stack in <br>> contact."<br>> <br>> The second sentence is wrong. <br><br>No it isn't! The sentence, as mark pointed, is a recursive <br>definition which is correct. I teach Functional Programming, <br>so there is some professional bias on this :-)<br><br>> "GOAL - When - in the board - are only stacks with at least one <br>DVONN <br>> stone, or both players pass, wins the one with more prisoners (of <br>> either color)."<br>> <br>> This is wrong too. The game simply ends when both players can no <br>> longer move. But, almost always, there are still stacks which <br>contain <br>> no Dvonn stone at the end of game. <br><br>Ok! Thanks for the correction<br><br>> BTW, you can play Dvonn online on www.brettspielwelt.de<br><br>Added to the site!<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
