    <div>Now about the game itself.  I haven't actually played, so this<br>is purely speculative, but won't the "go for zero" strategy<br>completely dominate?  It's trivial to just keep dropping stones<br>anywhere they don't connect, so unless the other players adopt<br>the "zero" strategy too, zero will always win.  If all players<br>adopt the zero strategy, then the board will fill up with unconnected<br>stones, until a win is determined at the last moment when only<br>the corners remain unclaimed.</div>
