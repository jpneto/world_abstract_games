    <div>Abstract games have been given the short end of the stick in the table<br>game arena.  I believe this should be dealt with.  As a result, I am<br>looking to get an association started to promote abstract strategy<br>games.  There is a petition you can "sign" on the Web to express your<br>support, and a forum to discuss the idea.<br><br>The forum is here on the Super Duper Games Site:<br>http://forums.superdupergames.org/viewforum.php?f=3D14<br><br>If you are interested in having one started, please sign the<br>petition:<br>http://www.petitiononline.com/asggroup/petition.html<br><br>The name IAGO (International Abstract Games Organization) was proposed<br>as a possible name by Bill Taylor on rec.games.abstract, and I happen<br>to think that is a cool name myself.<br><br>Anyhow, if you want to get involved, pleas sign the petition and visit<br>the forum.<br><br>Thank you for your time...<br>- Richard</div>
