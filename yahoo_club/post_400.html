    <div>Recently I came across an interesting game called Farook but the rules I<br>have are incomplete so I'm looking for an intact copy. The game is abstract<br>and attracted my attention for several reasons. Apparently there was a<br>computer version of Farook that supported seven levels of mastery and the<br>game publisher, Amuse Inc., offered $1000 to anyone who could beat their<br>computer at the champion level. The game was also a Mensa select game one<br>year and was on the Games 100. Admittedly, none of these prove it's a good<br>game; some of the Mensa select games have been surprisingly mediocre and the<br>Games 100 selections have often been controversial, but I am curious now to<br>try the game. If anyone can point me to a copy of the rules I would<br>appreciate it. <br><br>-Mike Schoessow</div>
