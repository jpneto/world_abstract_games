    <div>As most of you know, The World of Abstract Games (WAG) website <br>consists of a large collection of abstract games divides into 4 main <br>sections: Go variants / Games of Soldiers / Games of King and <br>Soldiers / Games of Towers<br><br>At this point, my stock of known games yet to publish in WAG is <br>becoming thin (I still have ~20, but that's just 3 months). I want to <br>ask you guys the following:<br><br> - Check in your archives if you have some more game rules fitting <br>the criteria mentioned above (and send them to me, if you have any)<br><br> - Check the Unknown game section <br>(http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/unknown.htm) and see if you know any <br>of those games<br><br> - What do you think of a new section? I mean, what would be the <br>focus of a new group of games? I have one sugestion: puzzles (ie, <br>games for one player) played on a Go board. Do you think it would be <br>interesting? More ideas?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
