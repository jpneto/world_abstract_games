    <div>> I don't want to insult simultaneous games and say they're less pure <br>> than sequential games, but suffice to say that in general the notion of <br>> simultaneous moves doesn't hold an immediate appeal for me.<br><br>There seem to be at least two different kinds of simultaneous games: 1) <br>games, where you decide the move of pieces of your own, and 2) games <br>(like Ricochet Robot) where all players have to deal with shared pieces. <br>The latter is a game of perfect information, but strongly contrasting <br>eg. to Chess (or Byte) for its uncomfortable feeling of constant time <br>pressure.<br><br>Dieter</div>
