    <div>Seega is an old Egyptian board game. There are a lot of links for <br>the basic game (eg, http://nabataea.net/seega.html) but there are <br>variants (the Zillions package provides a slightly different one).<br><br>This next site (http://www.ipl.org/youth/cquest/middle-<br>east/eggames.html) presents yet another game with the same name: <br><br>On a NxN board (N varies from 3 to 9) each player starts with N <br>friendly stone on his first row. Each stone may move one or two <br>cells in any direction (orthogonal and diagonal, it seems) but <br>cannot jump over other stones. Wins the player that makes a <br>orthogonal or diagonal N in-a-row (except, of course, in his first <br>row). In my opinion, 7x7 seems already too big to play with these <br>rules. <br><br>I'm posting this because in my trip to Egypt I saw in a simple shop, <br>a 4x4 checkered board with 4 equal stones for each player, which <br>seems to fit this description. Do any of you know any other game <br>from Egypt played with this material?<br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
