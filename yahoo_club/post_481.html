    <div>> It is quite difficult to make a new game, when there are so many <br>games. There are many "similar" games, with one or two slight <br>differences. Or a new game that is a mixture of 2 or 3 different <br>games. I have studied several (about 40) games from Joao's list, and <br>these things can be seen easily.<br>> <br>> I think that the problem is that the new game is "slightly" <br>different, so in reality it is a different game, has a different name <br>and can have its copyright. For example Rolit is for 4 players and <br>uses different pieces from Othello. So it is a new game.<br><br>True, and it's hard to draw a clear, bright line between a trivial <br>change and one that makes a serious enhancement to play value. For <br>instance, the fundamental idea of Quoridor can be found in lots of <br>earlier games, but Quoridor (IMHO) is a much better game than e.g. <br>Blockade. A Blockade/Quoridor-type game tends to generate positions <br>that are very hard to analyze, and the simplifications in Quoridor <br>(only one pawn each, small board, not too many barriers) both makes <br>the game more elegant and protects it from opacity.<br><br>On the other hand, does the fixed opening of Othello improve Reversi? <br>It may possibly reduce the first-player advantage a bit, but is that <br>enough to call it an "original" game? Of course, the original <br>inventors of Reversi had been dead for quite awhile before Othello <br>was published, so the point seems a little academic. I'm glad they <br>published Othello, because a lot of people have played it who would <br>never have heard of Reversi.</div>
