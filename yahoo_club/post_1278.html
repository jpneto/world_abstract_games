You won't be obviously locked into a move cycle.  Eventually<br>> I suppose either a position will repeat itself or someone will win,<br>> but the problem is that it could conceivably take days before either<br>> condition happened.<br>> <br>> You can avoid losing by splitting one of your stacks into two of your<br>> own stacks.  Your opponent can't capture two of your stacks in one<br>> turn.  The only way you can't split one of your stacks into two of<br>> your own stacks is when your last remaining stack has only one of your<br>> checkers in it.  In test playing, it seemed fairly easy to avoid that<br>> situation.<br>> <br>> The mystery here is how the "30 minutes" playing time was arrived at.<br>>  I test played it for about that long and the end was nowhere in<br>> sight.  It just seemed like endless churning.<br><br>Well, Chess has issues with Drawishness.  The issue of a game being<br>drawn-prone needs to be resolved somehow.  A draw condition shouldn't<br>be an issue.  There are uni-sided escape games where a draw condition<br>is considered a win by side with superior numbers (aka, one side is<br>prevented from having an escape happen).  Not sure why similar can't<br>be done for other games.  It does force a player to play defensively,<br>but then that is the nature of the game.  They do this in chess anyhow<br>today.  Guy gets the lead, and then pushes things towards draw state.</div>
