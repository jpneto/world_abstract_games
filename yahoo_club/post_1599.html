    <div>New MSG Game: Flume (square and hex hex versions)<br>  <br>Square Flume:<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Flume_Go_rules.pdf<br><br>Hex Hex Flume:<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Flume_rules.html<br><br>Square Flume is an extremely simple game.  In fact it's hard to believe a game emerges from one simple rule, but one does - a game uncannily similar to Dots and Boxes.  Hex hex Flume is a tad more complicated with two restrictions on stone placement.<br><br>I've always greatly admired the Dots and Boxes architecture but I never liked its gameplay.  Now that I have Flume though I suppose it's time to confront D&B strategy.  I've ordered a book, The Dots and Boxes Game: Sophisticated Child's Play, as recommended to me by RWS.  I'm looking forward to reading that.<br><br>Square Flume can be played at GWC:<br><br>  http://games.wtanaka.com/<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
