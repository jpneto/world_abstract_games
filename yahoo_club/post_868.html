So they're essentially<br>just sets, with constraints about what can be added to or removed from<br>a set.<br><br>However, I don't see the distinction between Moscow Ice and E.  They<br>are both variants of Chinese Checkers, and both involve stacks of<br>pyramids of different colors, with only the top piece being able to<br>move.  E does have a way to swap pieces from inside stacks if the<br>colors are appropriate, but the stacks are otherwise last-in-first-out<br>structures.<br><br> > >Greg Lam designed an abstract strategy game named Rock, Scissors, Paper<br> > >in 2001.
