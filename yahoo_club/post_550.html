    <div>Some more thoughts about the possible 1D Curvature positions:<br><br>There are several possible live positions in this form.  A line of <br>one color could form a solid loop or one end of a line of one color <br>could curve in on itself in such a manner as to not offer a proper <br>liberty(sorta fractal).<br><br>Therefore, it would not necessary be that there be an attempt to form <br>a single line but many could exist.  The creation and destruction of <br>potential live positions would then make up the foundation of play.  <br>Could both players place in such a way as to form nothing but live <br>positions?  Is it possible to prevent an opponent from forming a <br>potential live position?<br><br>Of course, it goes without saying(but I will say it) that a player <br>cannot place a stone in such a way as to create an immediate capture <br>position for the opponent.  But with the above conditions, the player <br>could place and leave no liberty with the formation of a loop of <br>their stones. <br><br>The Ko rule would be recognized.<br><br>Then there comes the possible win condition.  If both player began <br>with a set number of stones, the player who places their last without <br>a possible subsequent capture by the opponent could be consider the <br>winner.  Captured stones are returned to their owner for use during <br>the game.  If the surface area of the playing field became filled in <br>such a manner as to not offer any more placements, the win could be <br>determined by the player with most stones in play.<br><br>Setting the number of stones would be a great area for discussion. (I <br>say, experiment with the standard number in a Go set.) And it is not <br>necessary that both player start with the same.  This would allow for <br>a form of handicapping.<br><br>But the surface area of the playing field would be the greatest <br>cosideration.  Needless to say, it should be at least enough to <br>contain all the stones of one player.  Possibly both.  I would use an <br>area of at least the square root of the total number of stones(both <br>players') in diameter.  This would mean that not all of the stones <br>would be able to fit, but it should offer a nice area.</div>
