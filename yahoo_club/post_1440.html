    <div>Hi,<br><br>My name is Ray Li, and I am a 16-year-old high school student. For a<br>class in Critical Thinking, we are required to complete a<br>semester-long, independent-study project. For my project, I chose to<br>finish and market a board game which I have been working on for a<br>while. The game is called Lineage. It is a two-player, abstract<br>strategy game.<br><br>My website is www.lineageboards.com. I would appreciate it if you<br>could visit it and give me some feedback on what you think of the game<br>and the site.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
