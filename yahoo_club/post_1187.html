    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>wrote:<br>> There aren't standard abstract games and non-standard abstract games.<br>>  There are only abstract games.  This completely arbitrary, off the<br>> wall description of "non-standard abstract games" as "[deviating]<br>> from, at most, one of the above factors" is totally irrelevant.<br>> <br>> You've gone from asking us what abstract games are to telling us what<br>> abstract games are.  If abstract games alone aren't enough to float<br>> IAGO then tough beans.  You need to figure some way to handle it other<br>> than redefining the term "abstract game" for us.  You're only going to<br>> alienate people and establish IAGO as irrelevant before it even gets<br>> off the ground.<br><br>Mark, "abstract game" is just a phrase in ordinary English, and has no<br>technical meaning for the vast majority of the world's population. <br>The fact there there is so much dispute over the finer points of the<br>definition just points up the need for a defining document.<br>Personally, I think a technical field like game theory needs to have<br>its own nomenclature, but I won't venture what that should be.<br><br>A second point: If a game is not a theoretical draw, then there has to<br>be an advantage for one player or the other (obvious). There are<br>several potential problems here: how do you decide when one player has<br>too much of an advantage to allow the game to be admitted, and do you<br>remove the game from the list if the game is solved/known/believed to<br>give one player a winning advantage?</div>
