You can put any games, or<br>any series of games in there and then play to a set number of points.<br> Please report back with your findings. <br><br>There is an inverse version where you play to cost your opponent(s)<br>points (raise penalty).  This would be useful in games where you a<br>doing round-robin or multiple players in the game.<br><br>You can see the idea here, and sort out how to apply it:<br>1. Players start with a fix number of points (player uses chips to<br>track).  Each player starts off by offering to risk 2 points.<br>2. Player can pick however many points to risk (like chips in poker).<br>Player then can raise the amount, call or fold.  If player folds then<br>that player loses his or her points he risk.  Other player keeps their<br>points.  Keep track of the last amount of chips that were offered into<br>the game.<br>3. If player doesn't fold, then the bet marker goes to the player<br>being challenged.  That player has an option to raise on an opponent.<br>4. If either player wins the game, then the losing player in the full<br>amount.  If the player to do raise last happens to lose or draw, he<br>would put in his full amount of chips.  The other player(s) in the<br>game, will only lose to last level bet if they draw, or none if they<br>won.  Example:  If a prior bet level was set at 6, and then raised to<br>10, on the case of a draw, all other player(s) in the game would end<br>up losing 6, while the person who raused last would lose 10.<br>5. Players can only wager as many points as they have and no more than<br>the player who has the least amount of points in the game at the time.<br>6. If keeping scoring for match, the player's final score is equal to<br>the number of points they had. <br>7. Another option for draws is to have it so that the person who bet<br>to win, on draw would lose an amount of points equal to the prior<br>level he raised from (for example, if it were at 4 and then raised to<br>8, he would lose four).  All other player(s) would lose no points. <br>This option is only recommended for games with only two players.<br><br>If playing with more than 2, players can manage to drop out at the<br>lower score, and only be penalized for the prior level before the<br>stakes go up.  You can also limit the new raise to being double the<br>old raise.<br><br>Another idea here is to allow a player, once per multi-game match, to<br>call a "do or die" (while raising).  A player who calls this either<br>has opponents fold, or if they continue, they engage in a winner take<br>all match.  A player must win that match or he is eliminated from the<br>match.  Ideally players would end up doing multiple raises or<br>doublings before calling this, to get a bunch of points from getting<br>people to drop (or getting them to cost a bunch).  Do or die in a game<br>with more than two players would still have the player who folded in<br>the game remaining in the game, minus current point loss level. <br>Whomever remains to play in the do or die game, will be eliminated<br>from the match if they don't win.  In the case of a draw in a do or<br>die match, the person issuing the challenge is eliminated, but the<br>other players end up staying in, losing the number of points equal to<br>the pre-raise level.</div>
