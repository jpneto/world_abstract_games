    <div>Hi Simon,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.  Jostle is really not calculational though.  The hovering numbers in the rule sheet are just there to explain the rules.  You wouldn't want hovering numbers in an actual game though.  They'd just get in the way.  <br><br>One time a guy showed me his game prototype in real life and went into his pitch (that he had practiced for game company execs).  Five minutes into it I was nodding my head and thinking "You really expect me to keep up with all this calculation?"  I pitied the hapless game execs that would have to endure the demo.  There had to be some heavy duty wishful thinking / denial going on there.<br><br>For Jostle I just wanted a combinatorial game.  After making this much progress in the CGT book Lessons in Play (p. 80), I needed to have a cg of my own.  I had to throw my design manual out the window for this one though.  Mainly, I would never release a game that just ends with pieces of both colors strewn about, the player on turn having no moves.  Yuck.  But that's a requirement of a cg.  <br><br>-Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Simon Dorfman <simon@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Hi Mark,<br>> <br>> This looks interesting.
