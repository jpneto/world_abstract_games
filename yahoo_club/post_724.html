    <div>> I didn't noticed the fact that men can jump <br>> backwards in International Checkers and a lot of noise propagated <br>> from that. I tried to correct those problems.<br><br>... "noise"? A whole new world of combinations are made possible by <br>this rule...<br> <br>> About your remarks between Spanish and Pool checkers: the <br>> differences do not change the nature of the game. They are only <br>> rotational and color change diferences, right? <br><br>not quite... <br><br>>> If you can choose among several captures each numbering the same<br>>> number of enemy pieces, you must play that one which captures more<br>>> enemy kings.<br><br>See the official rules of Las Damas Espa=F1olas: <br><br>(23) Ley de la Calidad : A igual n=FAmero de piezas a capturar, es <br>obligatorio capturar a las de mayor calidad, dama antes que pe=F3n. <br><br>http://www.terra.es/personal2/jlgsanz/<br><br>I don't think this rule exists in Pool Checkers.<br><br>BTW, if somebody would write "Black starts a game of Chess", I would <br>consider these rules as wrong and the whole source as not reliable <br>(whether the "nature" of the game is affected or not). <br><br>Ralf</div>
