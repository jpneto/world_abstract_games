    <div>>   I am thinking of which Abstract Games which seems drawish.<br>> Abalone is very drawish IMHO but what about Yinsh ?<br><br>The most drawish games are the ones that perfect play leads to draws<br>and the best strategy is accessible (like Tic-Tac-Toe).<br><br>There are even worst cases: games where a trivial defence tactic is<br>able to avoid any defeat against any player - imho, these games are<br>broken (and they are not so rare).<br><br>Besides that, any game that, after some experience a player is able to<br>easily prevent a defeat against a better player, really needs some fixing.<br><br>> Many abstract board games can't end without a winner eg. hex, unlur.<br><br>The "no draws" feature is usually seen as a good characteristic.<br>However that does not mean that a game with no draws is automatically<br>good and it also does not mean that a game allowing draws is bad. For<br>eg, in Chess the fact that a smaller army can still go for a tie,<br>provides very nice matches full of drama.<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
