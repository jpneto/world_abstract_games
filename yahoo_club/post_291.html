    <div>Hello,<br><br><br>> Do you have the rules for Sahara? Can you give a summary of them?<br><br>Not easy. I played it about half a year ago: <br><br>At the beginning the pieces are in pairs at the corners of the board, <br>on the left side "white" on the right side is "black". <br><br>Photo:<br>http://www.toysinternational.cc/images/Sahara.jpg<br><br>The pieces are pyramides which are moving by rotating to an adjacent <br>triangular "square" of either color. Pieces cannot rotate over <br>another piece. A piece is captured when all sides are bordered by the <br>edge of the board and/or another piece of either color. The first <br>player to capture a piece wins the game (as in "The Game of Susan"). <br><br>TruthForum</div>
