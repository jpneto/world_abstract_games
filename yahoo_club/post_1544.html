    <div>New game: 420<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/420_rules.pdf<br><br>420 is the elusive "Game of X", a generalization of Y in which three players try to connect the four sides of a rhombus with an X shaped path of their own stones, among other winning objectives. Note that the oddness of Y, in particular its threeness, is maintained in 420.  <br><br>It took me fifteen years to solve the "X problem", but in the end all it took was one more player and a pinch of good old American know how.  <br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
