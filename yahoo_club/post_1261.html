    <div>Some simple movement mutators that could be used without too much<br>difficulty:<br>Let's start with chess variants. Three simple related mutators are<br>"fission", "fusion", and "fluid".<br>Fission allows a "complex" piece to break down into its component<br>parts. A queen could "split off" a bishop which moves away from the<br>original position, leaving a rook in that original position.<br>Fusion is the opposite of fission, allowing a knight to move onto/into<br>a rook or bishop to form a chancellor or an archbishop.<br>Fluid is more flexible than the two previous mutators, allowing pieces<br>to move into, out of, or through other pieces. <br><br>Board Mutators is another concept that is relatively easy to implement<br>in CVs, in limited areas. <br>"Grow" is what I have in mind here. "Omnigrow" would add a row of<br>squares completely around the outside of a board, changing an 8x8 to a<br>10x10. "Unigrow" would add a row along just one edge, making an 8x8<br>into an 8x9. <br>You could also give pieces the power to add or subtract squares,<br>growers and destroyers.<br>Finally, the board could be re-arranged, with shifting ranks and files.<br><br>I have seen and/or discussed all of these options on the chessvariants<br>site.</div>
