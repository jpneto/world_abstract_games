    <div>BoardSpace.net is my favorite site to play at mainly because the games<br>there (including Dipole and Tumblingdown) are played in real time. <br>Also the graphics are 3D perspective, textured, and very realistic<br>looking.  It's about as good as, and in some ways better than, playing<br>in real life.  I've wanted to get one of my games on BoardSpace for<br>years and I'm grateful to Dave for finally accepting and implementing<br>one of them (Dipole).<br><br>Tumblingdown is a very interesting, very unusual, high quality game<br>which I have played and which I do endorse and recommend.  However I<br>would like to take issue with the "perfect", "near perfect" (on<br>another forum), and "extremely simple."  There should be a liberal<br>sprinkling of IMHO's in there.  I'm not aware of any reason why<br>endless cycles cannot occur in Tumblingdown which, if true, knocks it<br>clear out of the perfection ballpark (IMHO).  As far as the simplicity<br>of Tumblingdown, you have specially recognized stacks of uniform<br>checkers (kings), the possibility of more than one king per player,<br>kings being created and destroyed on a single turn, and two different<br>kinds of moves.  In my own portfolio I have two games, Copolymer and<br>Crossway, which are arguably much simpler than Tumblingdown.  Hex<br>isn't even slightly concerned about Tumblingdown.<br><br>Again, I'm not pooh poohing Tumblingdown.  Tumbling down is on a very<br>short list of games that I do recommend.  I'm just noting the<br>conspicuous absence of IMHO's (IMHO).<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "ddyer0"<br><ddyer-yahoogroups1@...> wrote:<br>><br>> <br>> Tumblingdown is a perfect abstract by many measures - it's<br>> extremely simple, with vigorous and immediately obvious tactics.<br>> Like yinsh, the play seems chaotic at first, but after a few<br>> plays strategic patterns have begun to appear in my mind.<br>> <br>> Tumblingdown has an interesting history.
