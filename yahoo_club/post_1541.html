    <div>> It is a mix of Go and Gomoku.  I am curious if anyone has any info on <br>>it.  It looks interesting.  I would like to know if it has active <br>>players for it, etc...<br><br>It is also the first time I heard about that specific game. <br><br>There is a similar game played by me and Bill Taylor that uses Go rules and its goal is to achieve a 6 in-a-row. It uses a smaller board and a dagger to balance 1st player advantage. Check the rules at: <br><br> http://sagme.blogspot.com/2008/10/go-6-moku-with-restricted-dagger.html<br><br>Cheers,</div>
