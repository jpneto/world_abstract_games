    <div>About negotiation and political games (check<br><a href=http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~geoff/political.html target=new>http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~geoff/political.html</a>) when there are more than 2 players, the Diplomacy<br>side is, imho, the most interesting side of the game!<br><br><br>Here is a related game, played by N players: the<br>US$100 dollar game (described by Geoff Wong):<br><br>"1.<br>Each player starts the game with $0, the bank starts<br>with $100. <br><br>2. After a period of negotiation<br>each player writes down a number (secretly) between 1<br>and 1000. <br><br>3. The winner is the player with<br>the highest unique number (N). <br><br>4. The payout<br>is $ (100 / the winning player's number). <br><br>:<br>As you can see winning with a large number (1000)<br>will only gain you 10 cents; ideally you wish to win<br>with the number 1; but this requires a certain amount<br>of negotiation. I only know of one game where the<br>bank has had to pay out the full $100, and very few<br>where the bank has paid out more than<br>$5."<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
