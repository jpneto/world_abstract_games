    <div>> Why must abstract games have only two players?  I see no <br>> justification for this assertion.  I know of several which use more <br>> than two.  Chinese checkers comes to mind, or is that game not <br>> included in the list?<br><br>Sternhalma (what you call Chinese Checkers) is an abstract game if it <br>is played with two parties or players. This statement has nothing to <br>do with (a lack of) "lifting up eyes". Coalitions cannot be part of a <br>combinatorial game. Never! There is nothing to discuss here. It's a <br>fact for game theorists.<br><br>TruthForum<br><br><br>> <br>> So, I say to TruthForum, "Lift up your eyes and see the infinite <br>> depth that is Abstract Games. Enjoy the various flavors of the <br>> banquet."</div>
