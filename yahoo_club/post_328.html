    <div>Thanks, but this doesn't help me. I left the book at my parents' <br>home. Could you look it up for me?<br><br>truthforum<br><br>> I don't have the book on hand to double-check, but I'm pretty sure <br>Rosette was described in R. Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for <br>Classic Games.  (It's probably in the section under Go variants.)  <br>I've tried it, it's a nice game.<br>message have been removed]</div>
