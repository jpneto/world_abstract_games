    <div>Hello there. I would love to see simple strategic<br>board games<br>like Go, Awele, etc. with a smooth time<br>or space instead of<br>finite discrete ones. Any<br>idea?<br><br>About Go, its discrete space could be made smooth as<br>follows:<br><br>- Play with closed discs about twice as large as<br>the usual<br>stones. Allow them to overlap. The parts<br>of discs getting covered<br>don't exist anymore. The<br>center of the disc that is going to be<br>played must<br>lay inside or at the frontier of an empty area.<br>(An<br>idea of Lionel Bonnetier, if I remember well). A disc<br>lives until<br>the connected component of friendly<br>discs it belongs to has got<br>a frontier of length 0<br>in contact with free areas.<br><br>- Or play with<br>squares or any fixed other shapes without allowing<br>any<br>overlap. A group is dead if no room enough is left to<br>add<br>another piece touching it.<br><br>- Or let the players<br>add a new piece with the shape they want at<br>every<br>move, provided it always has the same area. A group<br>lives<br>under the condition of either variant above. I guess<br>some other<br>topological restrictions are needed. For<br>example it should have<br>no hole inside and should have<br>some strictly positive area<br>everywhere. I don't<br>know whether it also needs to be convex<br>and<br>connected.<br><br>My dream is to have an oracle showing the best<br>strategy for this<br>last class. It must draw beautiful<br>pictures.<br><br>Claude Chaunier</div>
