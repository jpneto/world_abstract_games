    <div>Hello,<br> <br>> There are several examples of<br>this sort of thing. For instance, the<br> <br>><br>game of Nim is solved. Hex on an NxM board with N and<br>M unequal is<br> <br>> solved, and so is a game<br>called "Bridg-it" (also known as "Gale" or<br> <br>><br>"Connexxions").<br> <br>I would distinguish two kinds of "solved"<br>games:<br> <br>1rst: You know a perfect strategy or even a<br>complete sequence of moves that guarantee you a draw or a<br>win.<br> <br>Examples: Nim, Bridg-It, Outwit, Gomoku<br>narabe, <br> Abalone, Wayne Schmittberger's Halma<br><br><br> <br> <br>2nd: You have a theoretical proof that<br>the game <br> ends in a draw or a win, but you don't<br>know <br> the exact sequence of moves or the strategy<br><br> that you would have to play to "implement" <br><br>this theory in real life.<br> These games are still<br>very playable, there<br> are even tournaments.<br><br><br>Examples: 9-Men-Morris, Teeko (not clear if this <br> is<br>also true for the tournament variant), Hex, Sprouts<br>(not affirmed)<br> <br><br>Sometimes this kind of<br>proof is called "ultra-weak".<br> <br>As I am not a<br>mathematician, I don't care much about the theoretical<br>"solutions" as long as they don't affect the real play.<br><br><br>I am a Panther.</div>
