    <div>Three Crowns appears to be a nice game. It was first described in the <br>Abstract Games magazine and is also included in Joao's fantastic <br>collection of abstract games. There is, however, a small mistake in <br>Joao's description: Three Crowns was invented by Larry Back who (I <br>bet) has still the copyright (L Lynn Smith has only implemented the <br>game for Zillions). So Joao should change that before he gets <br>problems with Larry's lawyer.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
