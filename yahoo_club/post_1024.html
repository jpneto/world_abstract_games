You have to <br>>consider the context.  I�ve been there for a year and I�ve got eight games <br>>there.  A few people think highly of me and a much larger group, while not <br>>necessarily fond of me, think highly of my skills as a designer.  They like <br>>my games � something that matters in a gaming venue.  While we�re not all <br>>necessarily the best of friends, we�ve grown comfortable with one another.  <br>>We�re part of a loosely knit community.  And then here comes you � a fresh <br>>faced newcomer with one game under his arm.  Basically holding a pair of <br>>deuces against my straight flush - in the context of the situation.<br>><br>>   There are other ways to defend yourself besides presenting a scaled up <br>>counter attack.  Learn some diplomacy, some deference, some humility.  Who <br>>was right and who was wrong has absolutely no bearing on the situation.  It <br>>doesn�t matter the least little bit if I�m actually more of a megalomaniac <br>>than you are.  What you did was equivalent to a white guy walking into an <br>>all black bar for the first time, and engaging in a ham fisted brawl with <br>>one of the regulars.  There�s only one possible conclusion.  You�re going <br>>to get tossed out.  It�s not like the bouncer is going to say, �Wait a <br>>minute.  I think the white guy has a valid point.� Wise up!<br>><br>>   Anyway, finish your game and get out.  And don�t come back, ever.  <br>>You�re not welcome there anymore.
