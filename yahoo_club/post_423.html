    <div>I have been playing some email and face2face games<br>and I think Jade is in a very good position to be a<br>remarkable game. <br><br>Based on my small amount of games so far, each player<br>"chooses" a colour and use it thru the initial phase. <br>But then the pressure starts to build up, since both <br>players start to create positions where it may be<br>advantageous to switch colour. That interlude is<br>very fun and may provoke a sequence of transitions<br>between the two players.<br><br>I had one game position where I would win the game,<br>no matter what colour was chosen by the opponent to <br>occupy the critical cell. A true zugzwang!<br><br>Joao</div>
