Still, I think the <br>honorable thing to do would be for Kerry to step up and at least do the <br>following for his paid subscribers:<br><br>1) Provide some explanation of what is going on and what he plans to do <br>about it.<br>2) Make some good faith attempt at reimbursing those who remained loyal to <br>the publication and paid in advance (or minimally some form of apology).<br><br>It's only fair to those who put their trust in his enterprise - and at <br>some level, the cash amount at stake really has nothing to do with it.<br><br>Having said that, I think I have the right to decide where and how my <br>money is spent, "paltry" or not.  And when a contract is violated, no <br>matter how small, I think those affected at least deserve both an <br>explanation and a good faith effort to address the situation in some way <br>shape or form.<br><br>At any rate, I hope that Kerry steps up and doesn't "go dark" on us, that <br>would be a disappointment.
