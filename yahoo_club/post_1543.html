    <div>I put this up on the ChessVariants.org website and could use some feedback:<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=3DMSdualringtourna<br><br>Introduction<br><br>This format was developed as a way to handle an uneven number of players,<br>that normal brackets and round-robing and Swiss formats don't handle. The<br>format handles anywhere from 3 to 100 (or more) equally well, but with<br>greater time demands, the more players involved.<br><br>This format is meant to be run electronically, or where there is a<br>moderator who can set up board between both players, and reset clocks.<br><br>In short, a player plays two games at same time (one of each color), until<br>they lose a game, and then they are eliminated. Players play until two<br>players are left, and then the player with most wins, wins the tournament.<br><br>Setup<br>Set up here refers to how players are assigned in a tournament.<br><br>For example, in a 10 player FIDE Chess Tournament:<br>Player 1 plays black against player 10, and white against player 2.<br>Player 2 plays black against player 1, and white against player 3.<br>Player 3 plays black against player 2, and white against player 4.<br>Player 4 plays black against player 3, and white against player 5.<br>Player 5 plays black against player 4, and white against player 6.<br>Player 6 plays black against player 5, and white against player 7.<br>Player 7 plays black against player 6, and white against player 8.<br>Player 8 plays black against player 7, and white against player 9.<br>Player 9 plays black against player 8, and white against player 10.<br>Player 10 plays black against player 9, and white against player 1.<br><br>This format is fairly robust in how players are allocated.<br><br>Pieces<br>Same as in whatever game is being played.<br><br>Rules<br>Play is as follows:<br>A player play until that player lose a game, and then that player are<br>eliminated. Once a player is eliminated the two players he was playing<br>face off against each other. For example, if player 3 was defeated by<br>either player 2 or player 4, then player 2 will battle player 4, with<br>player 2 playing black against player 4. This elimination process<br>continues until there are two remaining players, and the player with the<br>most amount of wins is crowned winner. In case of tie for wins, players<br>play two games until they lose one game. A player can lose by standard<br>victory conditions or run out of time.<br><br>Players tying can be handled one of several ways. One way is to have<br>players replay the tie until there is a winner, or one of two players is<br>eliminated by an opponent. The other way to handle a tie is to have the<br>tie eliminate both players.<br><br>When one player defeats another player, in a game not run over the<br>computer, the player who just one notifies their opponent that there is a<br>new game. The player then pauses the clock on their other game, sets up<br>the new game, and then continues with their other game. If the player who<br>just won is white, they would then make their move and start clock. If<br>they are black, they would set up game and start clock for their new game.</div>
