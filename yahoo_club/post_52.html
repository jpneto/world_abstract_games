    <div>>I implemented multi-player Pente (get<br>Go-Moku9.zrf from the Zillions site), <br>>but the Zillions<br>computer opponents fail utterly to generate any of the<br><br>>multi-player strategies I see among human players. Sigh.<br><br><br>I think that is no surprise. Multiplayer strategies<br>include a lot of <br>different knowledge, communication,<br>threats, compromises, diplomacy, ...<br><br>Talking about<br>Multi-Pente, there are also some proposals on Multi-Go<br>at<br><a href=http://sites.uol.com.br/vascog/gv/players.htm target=new>http://sites.uol.com.br/vascog/gv/players.htm</a><br><br>These type of games must be a lot of fun to play. I<br>also play some<br>games of Diplomacy (Dip has 7<br>players and simultaneous moves), and the <br>diplomatic<br>part is a lot more deep than the tactical/moving part.<br><br><br>I really think that we have a great lack on<br>knowledge about <br>multi-player games.<br><br>Claude<br>Chaunier has a page where he describes a A* algorithm for<br><br>3+ players. Claude, I forgot the URL!!!</div>
