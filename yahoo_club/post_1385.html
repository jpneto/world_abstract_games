    <div>What I'm trying to do is, in some ways, mimic aspects of behaviors<br>exhibited in military encounters, or explore behaviors of tiny<br>one-celled  imaginary creatures, entirely by using a few basic chess<br>pieces and associative rules. There's no attempt to reproduce reality;<br>it's more in the nature of Conway's game of Life, which is part of the<br>inspiration for these designs. How is Life categorized? As I was much<br>more mailman that mathematician in my career, I leave it to others to<br>categorize my stuff. I do admit to being curious about the categories,<br>though. [Sometimes I want to know just what the heck it is I'm doing...]</div>
