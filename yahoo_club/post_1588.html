    <div>Here is a downloadable Dipole program written by Greg Schmidt:  <br><br>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/48174<br><br>No game engine required and no complex setup required.  Just download it and run it, period.  This program has a good quality AI that will beat you at the high setting.  <br><br>A number of downloadable programs have been written for my games over the years, but they've all required some sort of engine, or unzipping, untarring, ungluing, etc. or some sort of complex setup procedure.  Greg's program is the first one to meet my standards so I've included a link to it on my site.<br><br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/MSG_downloads.html<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
