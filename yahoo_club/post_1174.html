If there's one head and one tail, you start<br>with two stones each in the center and finish out the game playing<br>Othello.  The player who ends up with the majority of stones in Wiley<br>Othello wins.<br><br>Now what are you going to tell me?  "Oh, well see . . . an abstract<br>game can have random events after the initial coin toss but only if<br>those random events always lead to various abstract games being played<br>out."  Isn't that pushing it?  Is there anything in the literature to<br>support that?  Can we close the ticket on this one?</div>
