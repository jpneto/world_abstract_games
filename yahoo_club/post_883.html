    <div>Hi,<br>after some time of playtesting I feel comfortable now with my new game <br>"Abande" I'm proudly introducing here. It's quite original and - as <br>always - there are some twists you will notice only when you're actually <br>playing it. If you are interested and you have some spare time visit<br><br>http://abande.com<br><br>I'd be very pleased to get some feedback.<br><br>Dieter</div>
