    <div>Hi!<br><br>> You could hardly capture any<br>chain -<br>>not to mention isolated stones - because<br>your opponent would<br>>increase some end of it<br>before getting captured. You would then<br>>need more<br>moves than her to threaten the chain again.<br><br>[..]<br>>Instead of that I would like fractions to<br>>behave<br>much like whole stones at their level and to be<br>more<br>>fragile than whole stones.<br><br>I see your point! I<br>agree with your decision now! Besides,<br>the<br>discussion seems to show that are many interesting concepts<br>already<br>in the game.<br><br>>A territory's value<br>would<br>>be the maximum amount of stones and parts of stones<br>in it you<br>>could capture from your opponent.<br>Example, the following left<br>>upper corner is worth 3<br>points and a half.<br><br>__ __ oo __ __<br>__ __ o_ __<br>__<br>oo oo __ __ __<br>__ __ __ __ __<br><br>It's fair<br>and indeed goes in the direction of<br>Go.<br><br>====================<br><br>>Here is again the capture rule, in a recursive<br>nutshell:<br><br>>A stone or a fraction of stone is *living* if and<br>only if it is<br>>adjacent to an empty spot or to a<br>smaller opposite fraction or to<br>>a living friendly<br>fraction.<br><br>is it not?<br><br>A stone or a fraction of stone is<br>*living* if and only if it is<br>adjacent to an empty spot<br>or to a smaller opposite fraction or to a living<br>***smaller*** friendly fraction.<br><br>------<br><br>if not,<br>then this '+' chain is uncapturable (how to capture<br>the middle 1/2 stone?)<br><br>__ _x __<br>_x _x<br>_x<br>__ _x __<br><br>[notice that the 5 stones are living<br>as an whole. You have an infinite chain of recursive<br>calls of your definition (the middle stone has the<br>liberty of the others, because they have the liberty of<br>the middle, and so on...)]<br><br>and saying<br>***equal*** instead of ***smaller*** is not good,<br>since:<br><br>_xx _xx _xx _xx<br>_xx __x __x _xx<br>_xx _xx _xx<br>_xx<br><br>is also<br>uncapturable<br><br>===================<br><br>Joao</div>
