    <div>Harald Korneliussen on rec.games.abstract recommended using a pie<br>rule.  First player makes a move and then the second player decides<br>whether to accept it or not.  I am curious here if people see that as<br>a possible way to handle unbalanced sides, particularly in the case<br>where what side is stronger or weaker is unknown?<br><br>Like, apply it to Chess960, for example.  <br><br>Thinking in case where you believe the first player has an advantage.<br> You make a move that would cause your opponent to refuse white.  If<br>say the second player has an advantage, then you come up with a move<br>that looks superior for white.<br><br>Anyone have ideas how to make the pie rule work for games which are<br>maybe too strongly in favor of one player?</div>
