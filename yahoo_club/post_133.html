    <div>There was a contest in Sci Am in the early 1980s,<br>in Douglas Hofstadter's "Metamagical Themas" column<br>(he was Martin Gardner's immediate successor; the two<br>wrote columns in alternate months for a couple years),<br>in which the total stake being risked by SA was<br>$1000. As I recall, Hofstadter contacted ten or twenty<br>of his acquaintances, intelligent people all, and<br>gave them instructions to choose one of two replies:<br>"cooperate" and "defect." Everyone who "cooperates" adds $X<br>to the actual prize money to be distributed, while<br>everyone who "defects" adds $Y, where Y < X. But those<br>who "cooperate" also received only A shares of the<br>final prize pot, while those who "defect" received B<br>shares, with B > A. And I'm pretty sure that the ratio<br>B/A > X/Y.<br><br>In a two-player game, something<br>like this:<br> Other player<br> C D<br> C $50 $10<br><br>You<br> D $60 $20<br><br>Hence, no matter what the other<br>players do, any individual player would receive more<br>money by defecting than by cooperating. But the more<br>people who defected, the less total money Sci Am would<br>have to distribute. The scenario that would give a<br>player the most money would be if everyone else<br>cooperated, and he himself defected; if you limit<br>consideration to scenarios in which everyone does the same<br>thing (the "mainline" strategies), everyone would be<br>much better off if they all cooperate (in which case<br>Sci Am would be out $1000) than if they all defect<br>(which would lead to a considerably smaller total<br>payout).<br><br>Hofstadter's instructions further specified that there was to<br>be no communication between the players -- easily<br>managed, since I don't think any of them knew any of the<br>others -- and requested that everyone make the decision<br>that they felt would maximize their own<br>payoff.<br><br>He had the idea that even without communication,<br>everyone would rationally conclude that they should<br>cooperate, because then everyone else would rationally<br>conclude THEY should cooperate, and so they'd all get a<br>good prize. I think this is the kind of reasoning that<br>is referred to as "the idealism of the Sixties,"<br>which has hung on in academic circles into later<br>decades.<br><br>Nothing of the sort happened. Most people defected, and<br>the few who cooperated did so for reasons that had<br>nothing to do with Hofstadter's peculiar logic. "I will<br>be better off if there is a sound argument that<br>cooperating will make me better off, than I would be if there<br>is no such argument; therefore, cooperating will<br>make me better off." Except that it won't: no matter<br>what others do, you're better off defecting.<br><br>He<br>was depressed and discouraged by the results of the<br>experiment. I think it merely showed the (really pretty<br>obvious) need for social institutions that enhance the<br>likelihood that people will cooperate rather than defect,<br>such as the State, which endeavors to decrease the<br>payoff for defectors, and the Church, which endeavors to<br>persuade players to consider only the "mainline" payoffs<br>that can be enjoyed by everyone, rather than their own<br>interests, in choosing their strategies.<br><br>Mark<br>Thompson</div>
