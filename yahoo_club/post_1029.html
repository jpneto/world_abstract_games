    <div>Aaron: My message was not directed at you, but at Mark<br>and Ralf who are using a public forum to exchange<br>insults.<br><br>- Sam<br><br> --- Aaron Dalton <acdalton@...> escribi�:<br><br>> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>> Hash: SHA1<br>> <br>> I'm not sure you'll actually get this email because<br>> apparently you added<br>> me to your spam filter, but here goes.<br>> <br>> I am confused and frustrated at so many levels,<br>> Ralf.  You are a<br>> published author, a man with no small education, a<br>> professed Christian,<br>> obviously a man of no small intelligence, yet you<br>> have yet to actually<br>> talk to me.  I have never said a single unkind word<br>> to you or about you.<br>>  I have tried to be so totally balanced and kind. <br>> Yet all I have<br>> received in return are single-sentence lash-outs and<br>> insults.  You have<br>> actually hurt my feelings at a number of levels. <br>> This week has been<br>> more than a little stressful because of the way this<br>> has panned out.  Do<br>> you realize that I and the other members of the SDG<br>> community are<br>> actually people, people with feelings, with<br>> families, with jobs and<br>> responsibilities, with education and ideas of their<br>> own?  If you were<br>> angry and hurt about my decision, it would have been<br>> nice to actually<br>> have a discussion with you.  Perhaps we could have<br>> come to some<br>> understanding.  As it is all you have done is meet<br>> me with defiance,<br>> smearing my name and my hard work where ever you<br>> can.<br>> <br>> In response to your issue with Mark.  What you and<br>> Mark do outside of<br>> SDG is your own issue.  That is not my jurisdiction.<br>>  I am in no way<br>> trying to defend his behaviour, past or present<br>> (although I see very<br>> little insulting in this most recent email).  I<br>> agree that emailing you<br>> when you obviously don't want to hear from him is<br>> not exactly<br>> productive.  What you do not seem to understand,<br>> though, is the<br>> differences in your behaviour *at SDG*.  Within the<br>> space of one week<br>> you managed to directly insult not just Mark, but no<br>> fewer than 3 other<br>> members of the community.  Your tone disrupted<br>> everyone.  Mark has<br>> certainly had a few emotional bursts of rhetoric,<br>> but they have never<br>> been directed at an individual.  His pride in his<br>> accomplishments (not<br>> entirely misplaced I might add) has led him to make<br>> some remarks people<br>> have not always agreed with, but as the forum<br>> records show, he has<br>> always been ready to apologize when necessary and<br>> has always been<br>> sensitive of other's personal feelings.  He has been<br>> a long-standing and<br>> productive member of the community.  I am not about<br>> to start banning<br>> people based on external activities.  Unless it<br>> jeopardizes the SDG<br>> family, I just can't get involved.<br>> <br>> Ralf, I don't know how to say this more clearly.  I<br>> have no hard<br>> feelings towards you.  I am not mad or angry.  Never<br>> have I tried to<br>> directly insult you.  Never have I said an unkind<br>> word about you on my<br>> forums, in my game chats, in my emails.  You are<br>> welcome at SDG.  All I<br>> did was ban your posting privileges until we could<br>> talk further.  Before<br>> you began to lash out at others, I was planning a<br>> private intervention<br>> between you and Mark.  I only took the banning<br>> action after you expanded<br>> your fight.  I sent you a lengthy email detailing<br>> why I felt I had to do<br>> what I did and you refused to give me the time of<br>> day.  You have given<br>> me no chance whatsoever to actually talk with you. <br>> Anyway, your life is<br>> your own and you are certainly allowed to do what<br>> you will.  I only hope<br>> that if you choose not to try to reconcile with me,<br>> that you will cease<br>> this endless attack on me personally and on a<br>> project I have sacrificed<br>> greatly to create, maintain, and nurture.<br>> <br>> Most sincerely,<br>> Aaron Dalton<br>> Super Duper Games<br>> http://superdupergames.org<br>> <br>> P.S.  To the AbstractGames forum, I am sincerely<br>> sorry to have bothered<br>> you with this somewhat personal posting.  Seeing as<br>> Ralf continues to<br>> post publicly, I don't feel I have much choice but<br>> to respond the same<br>> way.  I sincerely apologize for disturbing you and<br>> appreciate your time.<br>> <br>> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>> Version: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)<br>> Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla -<br>> http://enigmail.mozdev.org<br>> <br>><br>iD8DBQFFS2PKvlYKTYgR0qQRAjApAJ9wB1syYnQL9m7NmDaLM1JNKtna6ACgogd0<br>> n+9TE3dty9MIy123DnI8dAE=<br>> =WxWm<br>> -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>> <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Correo Yahoo!<br>Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! <br>Reg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/</div>
