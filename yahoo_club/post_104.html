    <div>Well, there might not be much of a difference<br>then. With double-moves the one-color crossing player<br>is going to play a good move with a color and play<br>as bad a move as possible with the other color. The<br>other player is going to do the opposite to balance it,<br>focusing on one direction with the other color and<br>avoiding to help drawing a cross in either color. I guess<br>that whatever they do, opportunities to switch colors<br>are going to occur anyway, with single moves as well.<br>I mean, if you fight against your opponent who<br>draws a cross and you play as well as her, you are<br>playing exactly like her indeed. If she focuses on one<br>direction with one color and you fight it, you do the same<br>-- in the orthogonal direction with the other color.<br>etc.<br><br>Anyway, I like double-moves :^)</div>
