    <div>Hello,<br><br>is there anybody who knows Chess Morris by Peter Foyers? I mean the <br>variant played on a chess board with four pawns for each player <br>placed at the corners (or the 2-2-quares) and a knight for each <br>player placed near the center. Is it permitted to win by forming a <br>diagonal row?<br><br>Any help would be great,<br><br>truthforum</div>
