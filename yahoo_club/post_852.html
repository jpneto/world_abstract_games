    <div>I too would only like to discuss abstract games here.  Sorry to <br>arrive on an unpleasant note.  As soon as I got here I saw Byte <br>mentioned along with a desperate plea for help.  Henceforth I will <br>not respond to memos from Herman Gering in this forum.  <br><br>><br>> [from stackgames group] <br>> > I'd like to take a poll on how many people are relieved that <br>Ralf is <br>> > gone.  He had written a flattering article about me in Yahoo <br>> > abstractgames.  Said article has now actually been removed, so I<br>> assume that Ralf is moderator there as well.<br>> <br>> The moderator of Yahoo Abstract Games is me, Jo=E3o Neto, and, until<br>> now, I only deleted spams.<br>> <br>> I just want to remind that we are here to talk about board games, <br>and<br>> if someone has some problems please solve them by email, not in <br>these<br>> public forums.<br>> <br>> Thanks.<br>>=</div>
