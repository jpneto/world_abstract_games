    <div>The winners of the annual Mensa Mind Games <br>this year included 4 abstract games (though <br>Cityscape is abstract only under the "broad" <br>definition). The winners were:<br><br>Blokus<br>Cityscape<br>Fire & Ice<br>Octiles<br>Trans America<br><br>Trans America I haven't played, but it sounds like some kind of <br>geography trivia game. Cityscape fails to be abstract in that each <br>player sets his own winning goals (based on the final appearance of <br>the "city" being built over the course of the game) without the other <br>player's knowledge. ... I suppose you could play Cityscape as a <br>purely abstract game, by making the winning goals common knowledge <br>and having the players set them one piece at a time, alternating. Not <br>sure whether that would damage the game or not.<br><br>On the whole, I'd say the choices were pretty good, among the games <br>that were submitted for review. There weren't many abstracts <br>submitted other than these winners.<br><br>This was the first year I attended the event, and I found the review <br>process extremely tedious -- most of the games submitted were quite <br>hopeless, and must have been submitted simply so the manufacture <br>could get our comments on their games. Not my idea of fun.</div>
