    <div>> But something is missing on this <br>> game (e.g., how can I force the <br>> opponent to get out of his own <br>> cells? perhaps jumps were <br>> mandatory...)<br> <br>> Does anybody know this game?<br><br>No jumps were not mandatory in Jumpin.  The rules are flawed.  Jumpin <br>should always be played with a slight rule modification.  Mark <br>Thompson talks about this at his wonderful site:<br><br>  http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/jumpin.html<br><br><br>Ed Collins</div>
