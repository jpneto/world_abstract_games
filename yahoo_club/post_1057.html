    <div>Has anyone tried Pentago yet? I haven't, but if I've understood the<br>rules then they're quite simple. The two players are Black and White,<br>the board is 6x6 and has four 3x3 sections, a move consists of placing<br>a stone of your color and then rotating one of the 3x3 sections, and<br>the object is to have a line of 5 stones in your color at the end of<br>your turn. As far as I know any rotation of any section is legal, and<br>I haven't heard that there's any special rule about overlines (lines<br>of 6 stones). AFAIK both the placement and the rotation steps are<br>required.<br><br>I was just wondering whether this might make a good 3D game, perhaps<br>on a 4x4x4 board made up of eight 2x2x2 sections with an object of<br>getting a line of four. Would anyone like to try a game by email? <br><br>The 3D rotations would probably be tricky to visualize from a flat<br>board diagram, but there are a lot of standard 4x4x4 "tic tac toe"<br>games around on which the game state could be recorded, for<br>considering your moves.<br><br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
