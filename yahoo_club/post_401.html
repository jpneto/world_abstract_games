    <div>> some of the Mensa select games have been surprisingly mediocre <br><br>Actually, it's not surprising when you consider how "Mensa Select" <br>games are chosen. Publishers submit games that are being offered for <br>the first time to Mensa, and one of the chapters around the country <br>hosts the "Mensa Mind Games". This is a weekend event, which any <br>Mensans can attend who wishes. I'm attending this year for the first <br>time, but as I understand it each person gets a scorecard with about <br>30 games on it, and is expected to evaluate every game on the <br>scorecard between Friday noon and Sunday morning. So you might be <br>able to play it once, if it's not a long game or complicated.<br><br>So, IMHO, it's not really a method calculated to produce the best <br>result, nor to bring honor and esteem to the Mensa brand name.</div>
