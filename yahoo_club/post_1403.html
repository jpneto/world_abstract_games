    <div>This is a philosophical piece for the most part meant to give thought<br>to where things can head, and why.<br><br>I believe the framework of chess can be addressed now so that we never<br>turn chess into a solved game.  I personally believe there is part of<br>the answer in a game like Seirawan Chess, or a pocket version with<br>reserves, but I don't think they alone have the answer.  It also<br>doesn't address the framework issue either that gets chess stuck, and<br>all the classic abstract strategy game (stuck here means set on a path<br>to being "solved", without a way to adjust before it does).  <br><br>My take on Godel's Incompleteness Theorm is that you don't solve the<br>systemic issues with a certain set of rules by creating more rules of<br>the same type.  If it is show, for example with chess, that a set<br>configuration of chess pieces on the board eventually produces<br>something that is solved, then changing the configuration of the<br>pieces on the board alone doesn't resolve it either (one time, fixed).<br> You can change the their starting position (aka Chess960/Pick your<br>Army/MetaChess or the V and X versions of IAGO Chess), the layout of<br>the board at start (and also changing it during play, aka Beyond<br>Chess), or when the pieces enter the game (IAGO/Seirawan/Pocket<br>Knight/Pocket Mutant), and help to push things out further.  If you<br>build into the framework by which you can do all of the above, you buy<br>more time.  What regular chess has now is not a way to make chess get<br>"unstuck", allowing it to adjust over time.  I suggest all of the<br>above be considered and integrated, and the players settled on what<br>works best.   Eventually even this mix of everything leads to a<br>"stuck" position as the playing community may figure out what is<br>optimal.  By then, some other people will need to come up with another<br>layer of rules to insure things are unstuck.  <br><br>I can't say this for certain, but I do know unsticking chess by doing<br>all of the above should likely buy chess another 1000 years, using all<br>of the above methods described.  The key to having it get unstuck is<br>to have it done in a way that it is evolutionary, so the playing<br>community can migrate over time and get used to the changes.  Also<br>added to the mix are "mutators" which are meta-changes to how the game<br>works that get added during play.  Plunder Chess, for example, is<br>built on a mutator that is active from the start, pieces fusing<br>together.  Even these added can have an impact, and force people to<br>think more creatively, relying on principles.  These changes act as<br>weather, and another key element to getting chess unstuck (and other<br>abstract strategy games for that matter).  All these elements help to<br>battle to keep a game from getting stuck, without the use of random<br>element, or hidden information, which is the standard method used to<br>unstick a game.  Like, the case of backgammon, luck prevents it from<br>getting stuck for a long time.  Stratego uses hidden information, and<br>the bluff element causes players to play other players.  In this you<br>need to know your opponent more than the environment.  Because of<br>this, a game like poker can be played even 1000 years from now,<br>because you play the players, and luck also offsets (hidden<br>information+luck).  Magic: The Gathering, and also Cosmic Encounters<br>also relate to this, which has in its makeup things that continue to<br>change the rules. <br><br>Please feel free to comment here.  This is a philosophical piece for<br>the most part meant to give thought to where things can head, and why.</div>
