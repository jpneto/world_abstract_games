    <div>New MSG game: Riptide<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Riptide_rules.html<br><br>I hybridized a finite game with an infinite game, resulting in an extraordinarily large finite game.  Only the top one or two checkers of a stack are lifted off and moved - very ergonomic.  If Player 2 were to successfully mirror Player 1, Player 1 would win.  So there's no incentive for Player 2 to mirror, and Player 1 doesn't have to be on the lookout for mirroring or engage in countermirroring measures.  Nice.  My usual design constraints were relaxed in favor of constructing a really big game tree.  <br><br>I've tested this game for roughly about 20 hours over the past week or so.  I did find one error, which I fixed.  If it's still flawed, fuck me. I'll issue a full refund.  If I had to be 100% sure about every game I released, I'd never release any games.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
