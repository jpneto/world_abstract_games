The Chess division, for<br>want of a better name, would be classic startegy & the 'so contrived<br>games', they would be abstract stategy.<br>>    <br>>   What are peoples thought?<br>>    <br>>   Colin<br><br>The current base definition of it is the classic one found on<br>Wikipedia. There will be categories of games there.  These will be<br>needed for Athlons.  This means perfect information, and no luck<br>during the game.  I have been pushing for a randomization of the board<br>setup (terrain) at start, so long as it is fair.  Apparently there<br>were protests over when I tried to make a case for theme being a<br>criterion, or trying to have Stratego (hidden information) or<br>Backgammon (luck) involved.<br><br>Anyhow, people are free to put in their two cents what they would like<br>recognized as abstract strategy games by IAGO (the association).<br><br>I believe there should be three CLASSES of games, this would be:<br>classic (these usually have associations with them, except Mancala),<br>modern (Mark's games are an example.  These should be based around the<br>equipment classic games uses) and commercial (Gipf and Oct fit into<br>this).  These classes are important to be able to reach standards on<br>what equipment members are expected to have in order to play in the<br>tournament or be ranked.  I break out modern from commercial, because<br>commercial games will tend to have equipment all over the map.  There<br>could be a commercial class world champion, but that person is going<br>to have to own a wide range of officially recognized games by the<br>association.<br><br>As for types of categories, I believe this is important also.  It will<br>be used for Athlon (named after biathlon, triathlon, decathlon) events<br>so you have a wide enough mix of games of different types.  A few<br>examples of games I had thought of were: checkmate (these are chess<br>and chess variants), connection games (Hex), capture (checkers), and<br>territorial (Go).  There are others I have down somewhere, but giving<br>that as an example.  You could have an IAGO World Champ in each<br>category, and then a World Champ over all the categories. <br><br>This is my take on it.  Anyhow, the Rubrics of what an abstract game<br>is period is being discussed.</div>
