    <div>----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: truthforum2001 <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 6:55 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] How is it possible?<br><br><br>  Hi TruthForum,<br>  I neglected to indicate clearly that this situation is occurring at the bottom of the board,  which makes the structures half-orbits rather than orbits.  Half-orbits do not capture, they only prohibit (in the standard version, that is).  The points marked "s" are empty and off-limits for both players.<br><br>  Steve<br><br>  > .......<br>  > .......<br>  > .xxoo..<br>  > xooxo..<br>  > xossxo.<br>  > <br>  > The two points marked "s" are shared territory.<br><br>  This position isn't possible in actual play (I suppose "ss" are empty<br>  points).<br>  Either White or Black must have finished his orbit first and for that<br>  reason must have removed the opponent's stones inside before the<br>  opponent could make his orbit. After that it is prohibited to place a<br>  stone into the opponent's orbit, isn't it? You have two black stones<br>  in White's Orbit and three White stones in Black's orbit. How do you<br>  reach such a position??? Tell me which stone was placed last in your<br>  given position and I will tell you why the position was illegal<br>  according to your rules which say that all opponent's stones are<br>  removed directly after an orbit is created.<br><br><br>  TruthForum<br><br><br><br><br>        Yahoo!
