    <div>I was thinking about Hex, and the well-known fact<br>that draws are impossible because on any<br>completely-filled board, either Black connects the Black edges or<br>White connects the White edges.<br><br>I asked myself,<br>"But what if you were to reverse the colors of the<br>edges? Clearly there still couldn't be a draw, which<br>tells us that in any completely-filled board, either<br>one color connects to ALL FOUR edges, or else BOTH<br>colors IN PARALLEL connect the same pair of<br>edges."<br><br>Now I'm wondering whether it would be possible to<br>construct a good game on this basis: Start with a Hex<br>board, probably a small one since we're all beginners --<br>maybe 4x4 or 6x6. But it will differ from a true Hex<br>board in that the edges are uncolored. Each player in<br>turn places both a White and a Black stone onto the<br>board. The object for the first player is to achieve two<br>parallel paths, one in each color, connecting opposite<br>edges of the board; the object for the second player is<br>to achieve a single group all in one color<br>connecting all four edges of the board.<br><br>I call this<br>game "Jade", because of my worry that its strategy<br>might be opaque. I've tried playing a couple small<br>games against myself, and it seemed playable -- I knew<br>what I was doing and why. If anyone else is interested<br>in trying it out (by yourself or with friends), I'd<br>be interested in hearing what you think of<br>it.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br>Chicago, IL</div>
