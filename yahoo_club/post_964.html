    <div>You may be true, the rules seem be incomplete. I have just translated the rules from a Czech book. I wanted you to know that the author does not write anything about optional or mandatory capturing.<br><br>Lada<br><br>----<br>The game would be unplayable if captures wouldn't be mandatory. The game<br>appears to be related to Turkish or Armenian Draughts in which capturing is<br>mandatory. I assume that your rules are incomplete.<br><br>Ralf</div>
