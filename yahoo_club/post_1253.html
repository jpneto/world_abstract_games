    <div>Hey, Mark, you're welcome. ;-) Any time [apparently]. <br><br>Well, I waited 48 hours, not just 24, and did a little looking around<br>online to see what there was to see.<br><br>Mark, you're a bad boy. Ralf, on the other hand... hmmm. I joined IAGO<br>because I have an interest in games. I joined this abstract games<br>group to have an understanding of some of the crosscurrents I saw in<br>IAGO. It seems in doing so I've gone from crosscurrents to a riptide.<br>The statements you have made go beyond the pale. While Mark and<br>Richard can be petty [bad race* joke], you sir are being preposterous.<br>I'm understanding better what Christian Freeling meant by his remark<br>on game designers and a sense of humor in an email.<br>* - as in auto racing<br><br>This is my 4th post to this group, and I refuse to have more posts<br>here that have nothing to do with abstract games than those that do,<br>so I will start a question here, and follow it up later.<br><br>I'm interested in mutators, and get the idea that "mutator" is just<br>another name for "game rule". Is this the case? In chess variants,<br>mutators can change any variant into any other, so is there really a<br>difference between a mutator and a rule [other than the spelling and<br>pronunciation]? My original question was: "can gameboards be mutators?"<br><br>There's a line at the bottom of the preview that asks: "Are you sure<br>you want to send this message?" No, I'm not, but I will anyway, hoping<br>[against all hope?] that I will just get a reply dealing with mutators.<br><br>Joe</div>
