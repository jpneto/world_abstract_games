    <div>Joao,<br><br>I have sent you three messages to the emails you give at your "World <br>of Abstract Games" webpage and your "Game Design" webpage:<br><br>jpn@...<br>jpnREMOVESPAM@...<br>vasco@...<br><br>I have received no reply, and assume there is a problem with the <br>email delivery.  Perhaps you could post a reply here.  We have <br>communicated by email several times in the past.<br><br>Clearly, something has gone wrong with "Abstract Games Magazine".  <br>The webpage has not been updated in ages, and Issue 17 was never <br>mailed out.  I am reluctant to send mail to Kerry, because he is <br>probably flooded by emails now.<br><br>If you have any information about the situation, please post it here <br>for me.  Thankyou.<br><br>Gregory Van Patten</div>
