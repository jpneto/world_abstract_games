    <div>> In case of commercial games, somebody should really sue the <br>> publishers so that a little bit more quality is promoted by <br>> capitalism. If a car would break down after a few miles, people <br>would <br>> be outraged, but it appears (in regard to games) every sh** (sorry)<br>> can be sold.<br>> <br><br><br>I would much prefer they sue Microsoft (well ... keep suing and win!)<br> So many games are offered for free that I can't recall the last time <br>I paid for anything.  So I usually don't complain.  <br><br><br>> <br>> I contacted Robert Abbot via e-mail and he was rather sarcastic <br>about <br>> Americans who don't know much about Roman and Greek history. <br><br><br>We prefer baseball statistics.  Seriously, if historical accuracy is <br>important, calling a moving line in Epaminondas a phalanx is a <br>mistake.  Indeed, crediting Epaminondas with inventing the phalanx is <br>inaccurate (full disclosure:  I repeated this error in my Epaminondas <br>script before researching the issue).  The phalanx as a military <br>formation was used centuries before Epaminondas was born.  His <br>innovation was to use an oblique phalanx to pound one side of the <br>enemy's line.<br><br><br>> I encouraged him not to change the name. From a European point of <br>view, <br>> I love it and never found it difficult to spell the name.<br>> <br><br>You must love Rithmomachia.</div>
