    <div>I noticed a discussion of Abalone, at the<br>BoardGameGeek<br>website:<br><a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=526 target=new>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=526</a><br><br>Here is the discussion:<br><br>Abalone Comment<br>Submitted by Richard Irving Date: Apr 12, 2000 <br>Abalone<br>- is it broken? <br><br>With the standard rules,<br>yes. The basic problem is, that with the standard set<br>up, it is far to easy to set up in a "ball" that<br>cannot be pushed back or outflanked to the edge so it<br>can be pushed off. You are only at risk in the game<br>if you try to attack. Once both players realize this<br>(or even one player who always plays to not lose and<br>has enough patience to never get greedy and actually<br>do something stupid like trying to win the game),<br>the game is dead. <br><br>Someone (I think it was<br>Mark Johnson) sent along an alternate set up used in a<br>tournament somewhere that splits each player's forces in<br>half. I never played it that way, but it would make it<br>harder to form a ball than in the initial set up, but it<br>might give the game too much of an advantage to the<br>first player--basically the game will be more of a race<br>to see which player can get into contact with the<br>opposing that he has surrounded at the start. <br><br>The<br>game is so actractive in a visual, auditory and<br>tactile sense. I just wish the game itself satisfied me<br>an intellectual sense. <br> <br><br>Abalone Comment<br>Submitted by Thomas Fenner Date: Mar 30, 2001 <br>Thats<br>true ! Playing Abalone starting with the default<br>position often ends in a tie... or will be at least a long<br>boring game. <br>Take a look at<br><a href=http://members.aol.com/tfnnr/abalone.html target=new>http://members.aol.com/tfnnr/abalone.html</a> ! <br><br>Caveat: I just pasted the discussion<br>here. I don't know jack about Abalone. Maybe this is<br>not the accepted wisdom among strong Abalone players.<br>I know TwixT tends to suffer from the quick verdict<br>it receives from most players: "It's over too<br>quickly- one brief battle, and that's all." Whereas a good<br>game can extend across the whole board.<br><br>David<br>Bush, <a href=http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/ target=new>http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/</a></div>
