    <div>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?subjectid=3DInternetVsGary<br><br>Check this thread out on the Chess Variant site.<br><br>The basic idea is to have a game of chess (or any abstract strategy<br>game) and at least one side (if not both sides) collectively votes on<br>what the move should be. In event of a tie for votes, the first<br>proposed tied move would be the move the side would make. During a<br>given time period, people are allowed to change their votes.<br><br>In a single player vs mode (Kasparov vs the World) you have a top<br>player take on the world, or a group, or like the Internet. In the<br>case of the Internet, people could use computers to come up with moves.<br><br>Another approach is to have people join into a game as one side or<br>another and they would then have a rooting and voting interest in<br>their side winning. Both sides end up being voted upon.<br><br>Any comments here? We may have something that is doable.</div>
