    <div>Hi malaschitz,<br><br>Thanks for your comments. Good suggestion! Limiting direction of <br>travel would indeed make the game more Plakoto-like and would also <br>address another problem that has emerged: players with pinned pieces <br>can move a piece back and forth to wind down the clock and force a <br>stalemate.<br><br>I was initially worried that this rule change would mean that long <br>sections of the track would never be used, but thinking about it <br>more I see that this should not be the case. <br><br>After playing the game a bit it turns out that another rule change <br>is needed: players should be able to change direction if they land <br>on a crossing mid-move. I'll update the rules shortly.<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, malaschitz <no_reply@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> For Savoy (two player) is possible variant where player can go <br>only in<br>> direction of main path (for example on first crossing is possible <br>turn<br>> left and not turn right).
