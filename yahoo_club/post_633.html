    <div>> With the e-mail system, such courtesy is merely a mouse-click <br>> away. It need only be a simple form letter.<br>> <br>> But if I'm not mistaken, in previous competitions, eligible entries <br>> were published at the website before the contest was decided.  And <br>> the top ten were featured at the conclusion.<br>> <br>> In this competition, none of the eligible entries were published <br>> before the contest was decided.  And only seven were featured at <br>> the conclusion.<br><br>I agree with you. They have an email list of the participants. I also <br>sent an entry (wish I post today at WAG) called Iqishiqi. I would <br>like some respect from them, at least sending a message that the <br>contest was over. A simple "go check the results at..." would be <br>enough. In the last contests, I heard about the results (and the <br>contest callings) from AGM but the magazine is frozen. I found last <br>week, only by chance, about the results posted at the end of June... <br>It would be a mere matter of courtesy.<br><br>Joao</div>
