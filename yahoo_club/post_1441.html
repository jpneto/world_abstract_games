Crowd plays itself at a game of <br>chess.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>By the way, I have kicked the idea of chess moves determined by voting<br>around further, where a crowd plays a game of chess collectively. I<br>am looking at "Vox Populi Chess":<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?subjectid=VoxPopuliChess<br><br><br>The idea here is divide the crowd up into 2 teams, and each team votes<br>on a move. After both sides have made a move, members of the crowd<br>can end up switching sides. Points are scored for staying with one<br>side or another. It needs work, but that is the idea.<br><br> <br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
