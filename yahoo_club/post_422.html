    <div>I proposed this game (with some modifications) on <br>this board two years ago, and recently mentioned <br>it to Cameron Browne, who took an interest in it <br>and has been playing it by e-mail with other good <br>Hex players. They say they're finding it quite <br>interesting, so perhaps it's worth dusting it <br>off for another look. Here are the current rules:<br><br>Jade is played on an odd-order Hex board (except <br>that the edges need not be colored) between two <br>players, Cross and Parallel. Cross plays first. <br>The players alternately place either a Black or <br>a White stone on one of the vacant cells. Cross <br>wins if a group of either color is formed that <br>links all four edges. Parallel wins if either <br>pair of opposite edges is joined by "parallel" <br>chains of both colors.<br> <br>Draws are impossible. Proof: Note that draws are <br>impossible in conventional Hex, because when a <br>board is filled either Black will connect the two <br>Black edges or White the two White edges. So I claim <br>that when a board is filled, either Parallel or <br>Cross will have won a game of Jade. For if you color <br>the edges as a Hex game, either Black or White will have won that Hex <br>game; and if you then recolor the edges in the opposite colors, again <br>either Black or White will have won this second Hex game. If the two <br>Hex games are won by the same player, then Parallel has won the Jade <br>game; if by different players, then Cross has won the Jade game. <br>Q.E.D.<br> <br>Parallel seems to have a disadvantage if he moves first. The current <br>rule is that Cross should go first, since otherwise (since Cross aims <br>at a single powerful group) he gets an advantage by copying the color <br>Parallel uses for the first stone. On an even-order board, Parallel <br>has a winning strategy if Cross goes first: he plays the <br>symmetrically opposite cell, using the opposite color of stone. No <br>winning group for Cross can be formed then. <br><br>It seems reasonable to guess that a complete analysis, if one could <br>be done, would not show that Parallel wins on all even-order boards <br>while losing on all odd-order boards; it seems more likely that <br>Parallel would also win at least on some of the odd-order boards. So <br>perhaps giving Cross the first move would balance the game <br>adequately, though other measures may also be found necessary.</div>
