    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'd be interested in knowing more about your comment.  In what way(s) do <br>you think Scott has advanced the state of the art for game programs?<br><br>-- Greg<br><br><br><br><br>"mark_steere" <mark_steere@...> <br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>10/22/2008 02:32 PM<br>Please respond to<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br>To<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>cc<br><br>Subject<br>[Abstract Games] Game programmers take note...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Scott Nesin, proprietor of Games By Email, is the best programmer I<br>know of. Why, because he programmed my games? No. A lot of people<br>have written excellent programs for my games. Scott has decidedly<br>advanced the state of the art though. His Dipole program in<br>particular is outstanding.<br><br>http://gamesbyemail.com<br><br>Mark<br><br> <br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
