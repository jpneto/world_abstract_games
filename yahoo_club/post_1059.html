    <div>http://www.mathpuzzle.com/ has some information, including a diagram,<br>of a figure called "Klein's Quartic Curve". It's a figure with 56<br>vertices, each one connected to 3 others, which has loads of<br>symmetries. There are 84 edges, I think. The smallest cycle is a<br>heptagon, and if you follow an edge and go left then right then left<br>then right and so on, you return to your starting place after eight<br>edges, forming a thing called a Petrie polygon.<br><br>I was considering what sort of games might be played on such a<br>surface. Perhaps Black and White could alternately claim edges, and<br>the first one who completes a cycle in his color wins.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
