    <div>Just to steer the topic back to absract games (certain members are <br>wasting a lot of bandwidth off topic).  The abstract games Bashne <br>and Lasca are two interesting historical footnotes which also happen <br>to be cornerstone games of the ultra exclusive group, "true-stacking-<br>games".  If I may quote revered game inventor Christian Freeling: <br><br>"[Emergo's] origin is a really bad game called Bashne, invented some <br>two centuries ago in Russia."  <br><br>"There must have been some vivid discussions in some Sjaski club in <br>Russia, early in the nineteenth century."<br><br>"It may have been the vodka, but they felt they couldn't do without <br>it."<br><br>"Saying, as the Russian Chess historian Sargin did, that it <br>is 'difficult to make correct calculations in Bashne' is putting it <br>mildly indeed: there's an actual hazard of brain damage. Usually one <br>fights an opponent and uses a game. Here it's the reverse."<br><br>And finally, "Lasca died a modern classic. It's time to actually <br>bury it."<br><br>I have finally solved the puzzle of why Ralf is so aggravated by <br>Christian Freeling.  Christian is right!  And Ralf knows it!!<br><br>Preston</div>
