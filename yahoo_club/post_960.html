    <div>Copolymer is an ultra simple game I came up with on April 5, 2006.  <br>I've been play testing it for the past few days and it seems to be a <br>valid and most interesting game at this point.<br><br>COPOLYMER RULES:  Start with a honeycomb patterned board with an odd <br>number of cells, such as any size regular hexagonal board.  Each of <br>two players has a unique color felt pen or a unique color set of <br>tokens.  Players take turns adding their tokens to the board, at <br>least one token per turn.  Players are not allowed to pass on their <br>turn.  Define "connection" here as the placement of one of your <br>tokens adjacent to two *opposing* tokens (that is, adjacent to each <br>of two or more of *your opponent's* tokens).  Having done so, you <br>must add at least one more token to the board while it is still your <br>turn.  Your turn concludes when you add a non-connecting token.  You <br>are never required to form a connection, unless the only available <br>cells are connecting cells for you.  Once the board fills up, the <br>player who has claimed the majority of cells wins.<br><br>NOTES:  There is a tendency in beginner play to maximize one's token <br>count on every turn, but it's usually best not to do that.  For <br>example, suppose on one of your turns you can claim a maximum of <br>five cells, and that doing so would enable your opponent to claim <br>seven cells.  Alternatively, if you only claim three cells (less <br>than your maximum possible), enabling your opponent to claim only <br>two, such a play might be more advantageous.<br><br>The influence of Dots and Boxes on Copolymer is apparent, but <br>Copolymer is different enough that personally I wouldn't call it a <br>variant.  The central, defining characteristics of Dots and Boxes <br>are the drawing of connections and enclosures, the claiming of said <br>enclosures, and multiple move turns.  In Copolymer, the connections <br>and enclosures already exist, and the claiming of a cell doesn't <br>always trigger the addition of more tokens in the same turn.<br><br>COPOLYMER RULE SHEET:<br>    http://www.marksteeregames.com/Copolymer_rules.pdf<br><br>PRINTABLE GAME BOARD:<br>    http://www.marksteeregames.com/Copolymer_board.pdf<br><br>PRINTABLE SMALL GAME BOARD:<br>    http://www.marksteeregames.com/Copolymer_small_board.pdf<br><br>Mark Steere<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
