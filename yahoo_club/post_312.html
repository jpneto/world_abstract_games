    <div>> Is Ludae's purpose to improve the skill of computer players, <br>>human players, or both kinds?  <br><br>Improve the skill of computer players by evolution and learning.<br>In a sense, it's the same as Zillions, but without expert knowledge<br><br>>What is the format of the tournaments, e-mail or online? <br><br>No, perhaps I wasn't clear. The tournament is a set of contests <br>between computer player that need to achieve good ranking in order to <br>move to the next phase (and provide info for the ACADEMY). Humans do <br>not enter in this.<br><br>>The ELO ratings look to play a crucial role in <br>>differentiating "good" knowledge from "bad" knowledge <br><br>precisely!<br><br>>but how are the ratings established in the first place?  <br><br>RANDOM player always has ELO zero. If you play against it and win, <br>your ELO will rise. Of course, a player cannot just play RANDOM, <br>because the maximum ELO it can get by this simple strategy is 426.<br><br>>I'm curious about the assigning of discrete values to concepts such <br>>as drama and clarity --- is it really so easy?  <br><br>No, but this is a thing that I intend to tune when information will <br>start to appear after some thousands games<br><br>>And can a computer be taught to recognize patterns in the same way a <br>>human does? <br><br>The ACADEMY will keep the "best" knowledge, that can be read by any <br>other player. So in a sense, the ACADEMY keeps all the knowledge <br>gathered by all previous tournaments<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
