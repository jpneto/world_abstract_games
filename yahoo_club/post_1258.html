    <div>Hey Joe.  Since Mutators have been discussed, might as well discuss<br>them there.<br><br>I think they are a great idea.  They do fit in the IAR under the<br>stability of rules section. I personally think you could base a chess<br>variant game, based around mutators, that would work like collectable<br>card games.  Of course, it would be done differently and leading to<br>far more determinism, like you expose all potential mutators you could<br>use during a match, before you start.  In other words, have perfect<br>information.<br><br>Anyhow, I would be interested in seeing this developed more, and<br>having at least one mutator based event in the IAGO World Tour, if not<br>a series of events.<br><br>Please discuss them here.  I personally like the idea.</div>
