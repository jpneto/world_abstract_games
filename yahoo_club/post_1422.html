    <div>Having not played it i cannot comment any more than to say it looks like it suffers from the same 'illness', for want of a better word, thats invaded abstract games - that of being 'forced', 'contrived' made into something that doenst work without some illiogical objective (or in some cases moves or captures etc).<br>   <br>  Why, you must ask yourself, should being the first into these squares bring victory when something else would be just as good. A nice mechanic though!<br>  olin<br><br>GeoMan <crushroller@...> wrote:<br>          I don't know how many of you have noticed Versus.
