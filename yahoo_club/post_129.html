    <div>> [dtroyka] I'm surprised you got 26 from<br>pre-1990. <br><br>in fact, I have some more on my to-do<br>list. There are about 100 games yet to put on the<br>website. Of these games, the pre-90's games are about 20<br>or so. I would guess there are about 50 pre-90's<br>games available on the net in straightforward URL's,<br>that enter on my very specific criteria.<br><br>The<br>goal of the WAG site is twofold: first, to collect<br>these games as a support for our little community; and<br>second, I expect that newcomers (and everyone else)<br>entering the site, see that some game forgotten on their<br>shelf is not on the list, and then send the rules to<br>me. It already happened for a couple of games.<br>Perhaps Lawson would be able to find some more on his own<br>shelf!<br><br>The net opened an huge channel for us. For e.g., here<br>in Portugal, I don't know personally no one that is<br>interested in playing strange boards with new rules. There<br>are a lot of people playing Chess and Draughts, very<br>few playing Othello and GO, and the remaining<br>abstract games are virtually unknown. Without the net, I<br>would had a very hard task to find someone to even talk<br>about these subjects.<br><br><br>> [dtroyka] Every<br>now and then I go to the US <br>>patent site and<br>start tracing game patent <br>>citations back<br>through the ages<br><br>I did some searches on Goggle on<br>the rec.games.abstract news (since 1992), and found<br>some games already forgotten. They are already on the<br>site. Does anyone knows other newsgroups were I can<br>find more stuff?<br><br>> [zadojla] I also believe<br>that a major part of the "fun" <br>>for many of us<br>is not playing the games, but <br>>playing WITH<br>the games. That is, it's more fun <br>>to invent<br>and experiment and discuss, than to <br>>sit down<br>and concentrate on playing a game <br>>frequently<br>enough to play it well.<br><br>Of course, the net is not<br>100% real, i.e., I also prefer to play face to face.<br>E-mail playing is fine, but it lacks some basic social<br>activities (and speed which brings nasty psychological<br>surprises and cunning attacks). I too are unable to play<br>with a computer... It's useless. I just use Zillions<br>as a tool, to check game balances and other<br>stuff.<br><br>cheers,<br><br>joao</div>
