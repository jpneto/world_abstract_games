That is, you aren't required to initiate your turn with a jump, unless that's the only type of move you have available.  Once you've made a jump though, you can't make any other type of move during your turn.  And you may be required to make additional jumps while it's still your turn."<br><br>I will take a shot at clarifying this pat too though.  Thanks for the feedback.  Btw Cage is programmed at SuperDuperGames, so if you want to give it a quick run-through I'd be more than happy.<br><br>-Mark</div>
