    <div>The world of abstract games website reached 250 games using one type <br>of stones for each player (and played on a square or hex board).<br><br>When this section started, back in 2000, my estimation of the total <br>games I would find would be around 100. They are 250 now and counting <br>(I still have 50 more to write due to my net searches). Together with <br>the games of Kings and games of Towers (this last section could <br>include the previous two) the total of posted games is around 450. <br><br>I suppose this is a never ending task, but the existence of more than <br>500 games with such strict material restrictions is, imho, amazing <br>(oc, some games are way better than others).<br><br>Jo=E3o<br><br><br>=</div>
