    <div>No, no diagrams yet. But the idea is that you have a 10x10x10 cube<br>made from perfectly clear glass, with its three axes oriented Up-Down,<br>North-South, and East-West. There are three 10x10 boards on the Down,<br>North, and West faces of the cube, and light shines through the cube<br>from Up, South, and East. The players, let's say Red and Blue, get to<br>choose single cubes within the 10x10x10 cube, and whenever they choose<br>one of these cubes it casts a Red or Blue shadow on each of the three<br>10x10 boards. (The players aren't allowed to play a position that<br>would cast the same shadow as any previous play: that's what I mean by<br>"not in any orthogonal line with any previously-chosen cell.")<br><br>Then the three boards where the shadows are being cast could be<br>interpreted as games of Hex. There would be some issues with such a<br>game, but perhaps additional tweaks to the rules would lead to an<br>interesting game. <br><br>I suppose the same concept also might be made to work with other<br>games. However, I admittedly present this idea in half-baked form, for<br>whatever it's worth.<br><br>Mark<br><br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "hermanreichmeister"<br><hermanreichmeister@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I understand how the orthogonal and one diagonal direction <br>> adjacencies is equivalent to a hex board.
