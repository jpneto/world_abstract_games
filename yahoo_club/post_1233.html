    <div>Mark, you have said the following:<br>http://abstractgamers.org/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3D145&page=3D1<br><br>You're damaging abstract games with all this "non-standard" abstract<br>games nonsense.<br><br>This "standard" and "non-standard" were consolidation points to your<br>whining.  As far as I am concern, the ONLY think you have contributed<br>to IAGO is the rules length criterion in the IAR, which actually<br>people don't like.  You gave some feedback on the front banner, but as<br>far as functioning, all you have contributed is whining.<br><br>I have laid out several things you could do here, but you insist on<br>whining, and picking up your blocks and storming off, like a child,<br>and not helping.  Even now, you end up say, "I didn't say RUIN, I said<br>DAMAGE".  It is all about Mark Steere, and not much else.  Multiple<br>olive branches have been extended here to you, and I have gone above<br>and beyond what is called for, but you still go ahead and act like a<br>child here Mark. <br><br>Anyhow, if anyone else wants to help here, please do.  The idea here<br>is to advance things.  If anyone wants to help, please do. Make the<br>zero IAR rating meaningful, so if you are a combinatorial purist, you<br>can at least get SOMETHING.<br><br>Mark, you are the one who is going to cause more harm, by insisting<br>things remain in the back alleys of the Internet here.  Your stubborn<br>refusal to be constructive is more of an issue here than anything else.<br><br>Ok, I will let you win this one.  You said "damage", instead of "ruin"<br>and also said "more harm than good".  Ok, you win Mark.  Why not throw<br>a little party for yourself and you small little world?<br><br>Beyond this, if anyone is interested in promoting combinatorial game<br>theory games, please get involved with IAGO and make sure they are<br>emphasized sufficiently that they don't get shorted.  Despite what<br>other people think, IAGO is looking to promote these games also.<br><br>And I am sorry for any possible issues here that may of arisen that<br>are annoying for people.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>wrote:<br><br>> I never said IAGO was going to "ruin" the definition of abstract game.<br>>  Plastering that claim all over the Internet won't make it true.  What<br>> little damage you're going to perpetrate, assuming your organization<br>> ever gets off the ground, is to mislead some people about what an<br>> abstract game is.  To start with, you're including in your definition<br>> every game that anyone anywhere ever referred to as an abstract game.<br>>  If there's a reference somewhere citing Pin the Tail on the Donkey as<br>> an abstract game, then it's an abstract game according to IAGO.  From<br>> there you're using your inexhaustible free time to create bizarre<br>> constructs to classify abstract games like IAR which has no relevance<br>> in this particular galaxy.<br>> <br>> With a name like International Abstract Games Organization you seem to<br>> be posing as an authority on abstract games.  But you're actually only<br>> using "abstract game" as a buzzword to draw people in and then<br>> manipulating your "definition" to accommodate every popular game that<br>> you think would further your agenda.  It's deceitful and yes it's<br>> damaging.<br>></div>
