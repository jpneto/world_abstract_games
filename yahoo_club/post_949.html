    <div>It's not a "plagiarism", it's a simplification so that it may sell <br>better. But the quality of the game has suffered. Btw, you can buy <br>white and black balls (at least in the Essen Game Fair) and even a <br>board on which these balls fit, playing many interesting games not just <br>Stra-o-Sphere, but also Akron.<br><br>Ralph<br><br>> Thank you for exposing Pylos, Ralph.</div>
