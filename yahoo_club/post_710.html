    <div>Hi Cameron,<br><br>you truly wrote an epochal work which will be considered one of the <br>major contributions to board game studies at the end of the 21 <br>century. It's an amazing scientific work although you appear to be <br>too humble to acknowledge that it is a scientific work at all in your <br>preface. Your book will be the foundation of many discussions yet to <br>come.<br><br><br>----------<br><br>Browne's book on "connection games" will stir up the discussion on <br>game categories. While I suggested in our forum that the taxonomy of <br>games should be based exclusively on their goals, which can be <br>critisized as too simplistic, Browne tried a far more comprehensive <br>approach by taking into account the full characteristics of a game. <br>However, such an ambitious approach is even more susceptible to <br>criticism. Let me give two examples:<br><br>1.<br>Troll is considered a connection game by Browne, while Gomullo is not.<br><br>From a historic point of view (another way to create a taxonomy) both <br>games are merely variants of Reversi. Gomullo's object is to connect <br>opposite board edges with the shortest possible orthogonal line of <br>stones of one color and this is always a row exactly as long as the <br>order n of the quadratic Gomullo board, while in Troll any connection <br>counts for victory. Sometimes truth can be ambigious: Troll's winning <br>condition is a connection and a row at the same time, and the game <br>could, therefore, be considered a connection game as well as a n-in-a-<br>row (fixed pattern) game. Any additional condition ("connection games <br>are those that end as soon as a specified connection, INDEPENDENT OF <br>SIZE OR SHAPE, is achieved"; p.62) leads to artificial borders <br>between closely related games.<br><br>2.<br>Go is considered a connection game, while Amazons (Juego de las <br>Amazonas) and Guerilla is not.<br><br>This is based on the (funny) assumptions that in Go "players try to <br>enclose territory with each move (moves are defined by connection)" <br>(p. 62), while in Amazons and Guerilla "the player to limit or kill <br>his opponent's piece(s) wins [and] connection plays a significant but <br>not exclusive role" (p. 320).<br><br>Is Go really closer to LOA or =C9coute-moi (Message 420 in our forum) <br>than to Amazons or Guerilla? <br><br>The borders between territorial games and connection games appear to <br>be shifted in Browne's Taxonomy so that sometimes rather odd <br>classifications emerge.<br><br> <br>Ralf<br><br><br>> Thanks for giving further details on Connections (which I've called <br>> McNamara's Game). I didn't make the connection that these were the <br>> same game and will add this to my errata list. <br>> <br>> The book does in fact contain Gomollu and Dvonn. These are included <br>> in Figure 10.1, the list of Connection-Related games, which are <br>> those games in which connection plays a significant but not <br>> exclusive role. <br>> <br>> Thanks for mentioning Blox, I'll check it out. If you find any <br>other <br>> games I've missed please let me know.<br>> <br>> In terms of games such as Trax and Havannah that cross more than <br>one <br>> category, I'd agree that these can be regarded bastard games with <br>> their feet in more than one group. I simply chose to put them in <br>the <br>> group that I considered to be the dominant to simplify their <br>> classification.<br>> <br>> Regards,<br>> Cameron</div>
