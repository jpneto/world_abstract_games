    <div>Dispatch is described at<br><br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/dispatch.htm<br><br>My review:<br><br>Dispatch isn't a new game, but a variant of Pentamino Go which was<br>described by Wayne Schmittberger in his book "New Rules for Classic<br>Games" (in: "Omino Go"). <br><br>Schmittberger's original game is more elegant, since it goes without<br>artificial and unnecessary rules such as "dispatching" while they<br>result in a game which is pretty much the same as Dispatch, except<br>that it has more combinatorial variety.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
