    <div>There are a few mistakes in the description of Dvonn on <br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/dvonn.htm<br><br>First of all, the game has just two phases. What Joao calls Phase 1 <br>and 2, is actually (logically and officially) one phase which <br>consists of putting pieces on the board, one by one, first the Dvonn <br>pieces, then the other pieces.<br><br><br>Joao Neto writes:<br><br>"After each move, any stack not in contact with a DVONN piece is <br>captured by the player that made the move.  A stack is in contact if <br>it has a DVONN stone, or is adjacent to another stack in contact."<br><br>The second sentence is wrong. A stack is in contact if it has a Dvonn <br>piece, or if it is connected with a Dvonn piece (or a stack which <br>contains a Dvonn piece) through an unbroken chain of pieces. <br><br>He also writes:<br><br>"GOAL - When - in the board - are only stacks with at least one DVONN <br>stone, or both players pass, wins the one with more prisoners (of <br>either color)."<br><br>This is wrong too. The game simply ends when both players can no <br>longer move. But, almost always, there are still stacks which contain <br>no Dvonn stone at the end of game. Also, there are situations when <br>only stacks with Dvonn stones remain, but the game is not yet <br>finished. The player wins who controls more pieces. You control all <br>stacks which have your headstones on top. For that reason, prisoners <br>(no matter which color; even inncluding Dvonn stones) as well as <br>headstones (the pieces on top of stacks) are added together (not only <br>the prisoners are counted).<br><br>BTW, you can play Dvonn online on www.brettspielwelt.de<br><br>TruthForum</div>
