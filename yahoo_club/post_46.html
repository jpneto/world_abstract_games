    <div>Hi, I just joined. Some general comments here,<br>then I'll respond in separate posts to some of the<br>earlier messages.<br><br>I have a collection of over a<br>thousand games, the majority being abstract games favoring<br>strategy over tactics, since that is the kind I prefer.<br>However, I will also buy a game regardless of the rules if<br>it has an interesting board or pieces. I like<br>inventing my own games with them. (At the moment I'm trying<br>to convice myself to buy an Icehouse (Martian) chess<br>set to invent with, but they want a lot of money for<br>just a handful of small plastic<br>pieces!)<br><br>Terrace started out that way, but once I tried it, it<br>became one of my favorites. Some classics I really like<br>include Focus (aka Domination) (zrf difficult, due to<br>stacking pieces), Ploy, Ultima (new zrf coming soon), and<br>Lines of Action (which I've implemented in a zrf, now<br>in final testing). Actually I like so many old games<br>it's hard to mention just a few.<br><br>When I was<br>growing up, it seemed like several new abstract board<br>games showed up in the toy stores every year, and since<br>they were mass-marketed they were fairly inexpensive.<br>These days you hardly ever see a new game in the<br>main-stream stores, and those that show up in specialty game<br>stores are really pricy!<br><br>Considering how<br>difficult and costly it is to get a game published, I am<br>continually amazed at how many flawed games get released. I<br>have many games which aren't particularly fun to play<br>as written, but which with very minor tweaking of<br>the rules can be turned into great games. I'd like to<br>hear from any of you who have fixed a "flawed"<br>game.<br><br>At the risk of inviting flames, I consider regular<br>8x8 Othello to be flawed (larger size boards are more<br>interesting) because the optimal strategy becomes obvious<br>after playing only a few games, and a novice programmer<br>can easily get a computer to play that algorithm<br>perfectly. (I have a minor rule change (soon to be a zrf)<br>which makes better use of the Othello pieces than<br>Othello itself does, and greatly improves the game.<br>Anyone care to guess before I post it? I'm wondering how<br>obvious my improvement is to others.)<br><br>I am very<br>good at thinking deep into minimax game trees (i.e.<br>many moves ahead), playing on 2D boards, or with<br>static pieces. So at present, I am most interested in<br>games with wider trees than Chess, where the board or<br>pieces are constructed or change or influence each other<br>during the game, and in games played in more than two<br>dimensions. Those are the games I find difficult to analyze,<br>so I'm trying to stretch my brain by playing them<br>more often.</div>
