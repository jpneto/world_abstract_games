    <div>Assuming that you're using WinZip, when you click on the Extract <br>button a menu will appear.  At the lower left of the pop-up there is <br>an option, "Use folder names".  Be sure that this has been selected.<br><br>If you using another Un-Zip program, you might read their help <br>section.  If available.<br><br>The point being, that the files need to be in their proper folders <br>for the implementation to work properly.  You can do this manually by <br>creating a folder named "Images", open it and create another folder <br>named "Zhadu".  Then transfer all the BMPs into the Zhadu folder.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Steven Meyers" <swmeyers@f...> <br>wrote:<br>> I don't understand what that means.
