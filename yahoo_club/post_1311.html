I would be interested in discussing various aspects of<br>abstract games with you, and would work at being polite. So, if you do<br>start a group, sign me up, even though I won't abandon this site, and<br>will ask you to look in at the IAGO site, also. <br><br>Something I'm looking at is high levels of organization to control<br>multimove large chess variants. I've restricted the ability of a piece<br>to move by requiring it to start in proximity to one of a few unique<br>activator pieces. <br><br>I've done some work on 12x16 boards which is at least playable. And it<br>indicates 2 ways to extend chess variants to much larger board sizes<br>while still leaving the game playable by humans. It involves a certain<br>hierarchical control of individual [single-square-occupying] pieces,<br>and moving pieces in groups. Guess I'm working on practical ways of<br>making metapieces for giant chess games, from arbitrary group movement<br>rules [SpaceWar] through multiple leader units [Chieftain Chess] to<br>chesimals, "chess-animals", that contain around 10 pieces and move as<br>a group.<br><br>If any of this sounds interesting, sign me up. If not, make another<br>suggestion of topic, I'm flexible. <br><br>Joe</div>
