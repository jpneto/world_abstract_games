    <div>> I'm a poor Trax player although I win most games. I don't understand <br>> why I win so many games so perhaps Trax isn't very clear to me. <br>> However, I must have a good intuition about what constitutes a good <br>> move. Perhaps clarity is as much psychological as mathematical. <br><br>When I juxtaposed "depth" and "clarity", "drama" and "decisiveness" in<br>the original article that Joao mentioned, I was thinking of all four<br>qualities as relating to the way human beings relate to abstract<br>games, rather than to innate properties of the games themselves -- all<br>of them as psychological rather than mathematical. (Though of course<br>mathematics can surely be made to apply, as it can to nearly<br>everything.) I mean by this that if there are other intelligent<br>creatures in the universe whose minds work very differently than our<br>own, they might find some of our clearest games opaque and vice versa. <br><br>> Perhaps the latter points to <br>> some "anti-clarity" (hey, native speakers: what's the opposite of <br>> clarity?). <br><br>Opacity. Or "opaqueness", but I'm not sure that's in dictionaries.</div>
