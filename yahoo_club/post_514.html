    <div>>I am well aware that many people in France and Germany, and in the<br>>United States for that matter, passionately oppose the war in Iraq.<br><br>Great!<br><br><br>>But you cross several lines when you compare Guantanamo to a<br>>concentration camp, or neocon foreign policy to the Nazi concept of<br>>total war.  There are no gas chambers or crematoria at Guantanamo,<br>>and the U.S. is not planning to exterminate entire peoples.<br><br>That's indeed true. But, nevertheless, Guantanamo Bay somehow reminds me <br>terribly of Dachau 1935. At this time the Nazi claimed the same as America <br>does now ("No, no, we don't want to exterminate anybody...). But what will <br>America do in 20 years? Truly, American policy is shocking. Nobody should <br>remain silent. If you do, your children will ask you WHY? Who remains <br>silent, will be guilty. There is a saying: "Oppose the beginnings!"<br><br>At this forum I said enough. From now on I will only post game related stuff <br>again.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>Schlu� mit Spam! http://www.msn.de/antispam/prevention/junkmailfilter Wir <br>helfen Ihnen, unerw�nschte E-Mails zu reduzieren.</div>
