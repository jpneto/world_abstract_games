They both have so much in common.  They're both posers and<br>frauds.  Ralf is on SDG using sockpuppets to give his own games the<br>highest possible scores, and Herr Richard is calling his group an<br>"abstract games organization" which it clearly is not.  IAG-Blow<br>promotes every game ever invented, including Rock-Paper-Scissors,<br>Three Card Monte, Bouncing Quarters for Beer, and Pin the Tail on the<br>Donkey.  Tell me a game that *isn't* promoted by IAG-Blow.</div>
