    <div>I'm glad you liked the Orbit article.  The puzzle at the end is pretty fun to work through, if you've got some extra time to kill.<br>  According to Mr. Schmittberger (p.66), Rosette was invented in 1975.  It's played on a hexagon-shaped array of hexagons, with 7 hexagons per side (127 total).  (Of course, play takes place on the intersections of the hexagons' lines --- I'm not sure how many intersections that works out to.  The game could alternatively be represented as taking place inside the triangles of a hexagon-shaped array of points, but it probably looks nicer the way it is.)<br>  It occurs to me that there probably aren't a whole lot of games out there that use 120-degree space.  Rosette is the only good example I can think of offhand that does.  Surely there are others?<br><br>  Steve<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
