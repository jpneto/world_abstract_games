    <div>I have the first two on your list, Barrier and Crosse, and can get<br>you the rules over the weekend.<br><br>I'm also very interested in any information about the Aladdin line <br>of abstracts; hadn't seen Courier before.  Other series I'd like <br>to learn more about include the Ravensburger "travel games" (small <br>square boxes) and the AbacusSpiele wooden games.  I have the TSR set <br>of four (Crosse, Steppe, Chase, Kage), most of the Gigamic line, nine <br>3M gamettes (some abstract), many 3M bookshelf games (no Jati), seven <br>Hallmark/Ravensburger games... altogether around 200 abstracts and<br>100 non-abstracts (many are borderline).  My "prized" games include <br>ConTacTix, Acquire (wood), Kaliko, the copy of Entropy that Eric<br>Solomon sent to Sid Sackson...  BeeLine is another connection game<br>where each piece is made up of three hexes (two of one color!) that<br>I would like to try at some point, when I have more time.<br><br>-- William<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, joao_neto_1970 <no_reply@y...> <br>wrote:<br>> <br>> In my searches for board games to include into the "World of <br>Abstract <br>> Games", I came across with some games that may fit the criteria, <br>but <br>> I only have partial information.<br>> <br>> I have made a small webpage with these games:<br>> <br>>   www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/unknown.htm <br>> <br>> Thanks in advance for any help!<br>> <br>> Joao Neto</div>
