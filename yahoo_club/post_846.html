    <div>> >Could it also move backwards to pile up (on a friendly stack)?<br>><br>>Well, the rules as they are would say no. But the game itself is open<br>>to changes. I only wanted to avoid tactics which prevent the end of<br>>the game.<br><br>Actually it would not be bad (and perhaps even logical) to permit it, don't <br>you think so? As you say, piling is irreversible, so piling backwards could <br>not ultimately prevent the end of the game. Your game tends to be very <br>short. In my opinion everything which would make it slightly longer could <br>improve it.<br><br>> >BTW, did you try to play AP just on one color of a checkered board<br>> >(e.g. 9x9 or 9x11; with nine pieces for each player)?<br>><br>>No, did you try it?<br><br>Yes, I did, but it didn't work as I expected. At first I thought that a rule <br>prohibiting two sideway movements is a little bit awkward, but your rules <br>work actually very well.<br><br>Ralf</div>
