    <div>My comment on one of the mistakes in "New Rules for Classic Games" (R.<br>W. Schmittberger,1992):<br><br>>Page 24-25: <br>>"Indeed, it can be demonstrated mathematically that in games with<br>>unequal forces and unequal objectives, it is impossible to create a<br>>perfect balance between the players, unless a draw is the correct<br>>outcome."<br><br>One consequence/formulation of the Curie Symmetry Principle is that:<br>The effect is at least as symmetric as the cause.<br><br>Ie. unequal forces can lead to a perfect balance.<br><br>For example, if you heat a circular coin with a flame from one side<br>(the cause - with one line of symmetry), the coin expands equally in<br>all directions (the effect - with full circular symmetry).<br><br>>My comment:<br><br>>It would be good to correct Schmittberger's exaggerated reputation he<br>>has as a game expert. He makes lots of mistakes.<br><br>Some people hate the word "expert".  Experts have generally spent most<br>of their lives arguing themselves into a highly rigid position; who<br>would admit themselves to be wrong at the cost of their life's work?<br><br>And finally, please read Games People Play, by Eric Berne, and Finite<br>and Infinte Games, by James P Carse, for some different perspectives on<br>playing games.<br><br>Yours,<br><br>LiPpyWanker<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Try to remember, it's just a game ...
