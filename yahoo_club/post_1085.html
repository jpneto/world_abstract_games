    <div>Hello all.  If anyone is interested in some abstract strategy games<br>done for the boardgame Stonehenge, you can see them at:<br>http://www.paizo.com/stonehengelibrary<br><br>Look up Rich Hutnik there, and you will see my designs.  I have 12<br>designs so far for it, most are abstract strategy on there.<br><br>Stonehenge has an interesting version of the Byzantine chessboard, but<br>it is 30 spaces round instead of 16.</div>
