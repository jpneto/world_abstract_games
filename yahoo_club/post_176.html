    <div>We're not saying non-abstract games aren't strategic, or that they <br>don't exercise the mind -- only that they do so in a fundamentally <br>different way. In what I call an abstract game, the player has ALL <br>the information needed to determine the best move, if only he had the <br>intelligence and the time to use it.  Not the "probably best move," <br>the VERY BEST move. Hence, if two omniscient players were playing <br>many matches of the same abstract game, and both were trying to win, <br>then either the first player or the second player would ALWAYS win. <br>That would not be true in Backgammon, because sometimes one player <br>would have better dice rolls.<br><br>It's arguable that the term abstract game could also <br>include "themeless" strategy games like Backgammon, but I don't think <br>game theorists use it that way and that's not how it has been used in <br>this forum.  Not that those aren't also good games, but life is short <br>and no one can play everything, so clarifying what are your favorites <br>and specializing in them makes sense.</div>
