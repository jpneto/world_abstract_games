    <div>I understand how the orthogonal and one diagonal direction <br>adjacencies is equivalent to a hex board.  That's a pretty clever <br>concept in its own right.  But I don't see how that translates into <br>the 3D cubes.  Do you have any diagrams for this?<br><br>--Herman<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, markthomps <no_reply@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> I just had an idea for a novel connection game. Think of the <br>squares<br>> on a grid as being connected orthogonally and also in one of the<br>> diagonal directions but not the other, so the grid is topologically<br>> equivalent to a board of hexagons. Now consider three such squares<br>> arranged with each one perpendicular to the other two, on the <br>sides of<br>> a cube (I think of them as the bottom, rear left, and rear right <br>of a<br>> cube, where I'm looking toward one edge of the cube).<br>> <br>> If the square grids are, say, 10x10, then there are 1000 cells in <br>the<br>> cube. Let two players alternately choose cells in the cube, cells <br>that<br>> are not in any orthogonal line with any previously-chosen cell, and<br>> mark the squares corresponding to that cell on all three grids in <br>the<br>> player's color. In this way the players play three simultaneous <br>games<br>> of Hex, and whichever one wins two or more of them wins the game. <br>Note<br>> that this is not equivalent to playing three games on separate,<br>> standard boards, because your move on any one board restricts your<br>> possible moves on the other two, and your moves on two boards<br>> completely determine your move on the third.<br>> <br>> What would be nice would be to redefine this general idea somehow <br>so<br>> that a move that captures the center on any one board would not be <br>so<br>> powerful on the other two. A thought: consider one of the three <br>boards<br>> (the one at the base, perhaps) as wrapping around toroidally, and <br>make<br>> the edges that are supposed to be connected go through what looks <br>like<br>> the center of that face. Then the centers of the other two boards<br>> correspond to edges of this board, and they aren't so powerful. <br>> <br>> Then one could also say that instead of playing stones of your own<br>> color on all three boards, you have to play one stone of the<br>> opponent's color on one of the two vertical boards. So you could <br>make<br>> a good move for yourself on the North board, but the West board <br>would<br>> have to be a move for your opponent, and the Bottom board would be <br>a<br>> not-so-great move for you. I'm not sure this would work as I'm <br>hoping,<br>> but perhaps some other way of varying the idea would do it.<br>></div>
