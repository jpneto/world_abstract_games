    <div>The name of that Chinese game is Tezhi Luzhanqi, or Chinese Army <br>Chess.<br><br>You can see an incomplete article about it at:<br><br>http://chessvariants.com/oriental.dir/tezhi.html<br><br>I've always seen the use of random generators as a challenge, <br>especially between very strong players.  Of course, I do agree that <br>there does reach a "point of saturation" when random generators <br>dominate the game.  So, random generators should not dictate the <br>entire play of an abstract game.<br><br>Another example of an abstract game which utilizes random generators <br>is a game called "Mozaic".  This was featured on page 26 of Abstract <br>Games Magazine #8.  The players blind-draw tokens and play <br>accordingly.  This is a really cool game.</div>
