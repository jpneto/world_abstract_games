    <div>Tie me down.  Checkers variant #3563.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, markthomps <no_reply@y...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> Here then is apparently the first English rendition of the rules to<br>> Kavkaz Checkers, except that I may not have it exactly right. <br>Thanks<br>> Ralph.<br>> <br>> Kavkaz Checkers. <br>> <br>> Two players (White and Black) have armies of 24 checkers, arranged <br>in<br>> all the cells on the first 3 rows of an 8x8 board. White moves <br>first.<br>> <br>> A checker may move without capturing to any of the three<br>> forward-adjacent squares (diagonal or orthogonal).<br>> <br>> A checker may capture in any of the eight directions by means of <br>the<br>> short jump (jumping over an immediately adjacent enemy checker, to <br>a<br>> vacant square just beyond it). Multiple captures are allowed. <br>> <br>> Capturing is obligatory, and a player must choose a move that <br>captures<br>> the largest possible number of enemy checkers.<br>> <br>> There is no promotion. Checkers reaching the last row can still<br>> capture or be captured, but cannot move otherwise.<br>> <br>> A player loses when it is his turn and he has no legal move. It<br>> follows that draws are impossible.<br>> <br>> <br>> This strikes me as a "standard" checkers variant, the one novel<br>> feature (certainly a significant one) being the lack of promotion.<br>> <br>> Mark Thompson<br>></div>
