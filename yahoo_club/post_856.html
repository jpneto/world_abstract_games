    <div>I agree with something you said, but not with all. In the following I<br>give my point of view. Please excuse the use of CAPS: it is for<br>underlining concepts that I consider important, and in no way it is<br>intended as screaming.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Mark Steere <marksteere@g...> wrote:<br>><br>> There are three problems an abstract game can have: draws, ties, and<br>> first move advantage (by this I also mean to include second move <br>> advantage). <br><br>I think there are many problems an abstract game (and any game) can<br>have. It may be BORING (worst problem), too fiddly (think of many<br>grand variations of chess) or lack in some of the quality described by<br>Mark Thompson in his famous article (clarity, depth, decisivenes...)<br>and the list doesn't stop here.<br>However I agree that the one you mention are common flaws of games.<br><br><br>> Why are these characteristics such a problem? The more expert <br>> players become,the more prominent the flaws become. For example two<br>> expert Chess players might have at least a 60 percent chance of <br>> having a draw, and in Checkers it might be over 80 percent. To me <br>> draws are the bane of abstract games.<br>> Picture yourself playing a friend and the game is taking twice the <br>> usual amount of time. You realize it's a draw, but your opponent <br>> thinks he can win with "just a little more time". In the end I have<br>> to concede it's just a matter of opinion. Some Chess players pride <br>> themselves on being able to force a draw. I pride myself on not <br>> releasing draw prone games. Of the three afflictions, ties are <br>> probably the least offensive. But again, the more<br>> expert players become, the more frequently ties will occur.<br><br>As a checkers player, I agree that drawn-out (pun unintended) draws<br>can be very boring. However if the players are of similar skill they<br>usually realize at similar times that the game is a draw. Before that<br>the game is still very exciting, with one side trying to "squeeze out"<br>an half point, and the other trying to defend.<br>I don't see ties as a big problem. If two players played at the same<br>level, a tie is the most appropriate result. Of course ties should<br>rarely happen, but they don't constitute a big problem. Sometime I<br>think that the komi in GO should be integer rather than fractional. <br><br>> My first game, Quadrature, was infinite (subject to draw cycles).  <br>> My next three games, Tanbo, Impasse, and Byte were finite and <br>> conclusive (no ties). I did my best to make each of them highly <br>> resistant to first move advantage. No game is perfect, but some are<br>> much more resistant to first move advantage than others.  <br><br>Actually EVERY perfect information game which is finite and conclusive<br>(no draw and no ties) MUST HAVE either first or second move advantage.<br>With perfect play one of the two players must win. The only difference<br>between games is how much this advantage is PERCEIVED by reasonably<br>skilled players. <br><br>> For example, Hex is finite and conclusive, but has a strong<br>> first move advantage, even among beginners.  Someone invariably <br>> mentions the "pie" or "swapping" rule.  This can be a useful rule <br>> for some games, but in the case of Hex, merely converts first move <br>> advantage into second move advantage. <br><br>Hex without swap has a first move advantage which is easily<br>noticeable. Go without Komi has a first player advantage only slightly<br>less noticeable. Go with komi has either a first or second player<br>advantage, but that is almost impossible to notice (and in fact we<br>don't know what is the correct komi).<br>Hex with swap has a second move advantage (second player can always<br>win). However this is much much less noticeable than the first move<br>advantage of regular Hex. Games of Hex with swap are usually very<br>balanced and enjoyable. As I already said EVERY perfect information<br>finite and decisive game must have first (or second) move advantage,<br>including Tanbo and Byte. However for Tanbo,Byte AND swap Hex this is<br>not easily noticeable.<br><br>> In any case, the pie rule diminishes the elegance of set of<br>> rules that would be simpler without it.<br><br>I don't agree. Any game could have a simpler set of rules if you<br>remove some of them. What counts is the total complexity of the game.<br>Hex with the swap rule can be explained to (and can be understood by)<br>the average Joe in less than two minutes. I don't think there are many<br>others game with such a simplicity. <br><br>> I've brought up this discussion before in other forums.  I usually <br>> challenge the group to name games which are finite, conclusive, and<br>> resistant to first move advantage.  The group response has become <br>> somewhat predictable. First there are shouts of denial that my games<br>> stand out as being among the few to have all three characteristics.<br><br>I know only Byte and Tanbo, but I agree that they are finite,<br>conclusive and the advantage is not easily percieved.<br><br>> Eventually someone usually correctly names Dots and Boxes, and <br>> incorrectly names Hex.  <br><br>As I explained before, Hex is not incorrectly named. Other games which<br>have these characteristics are *Star, Pylos, Fire and Ice. Those are<br>just the first ones that I noticed with a quick scan of my collection,<br>but I am sure there are others. Before anybody tells me that they have<br>a fist (or second) move advantage, I will repeat that everything is<br>about perceived advantage....because an actual advantage MUST be<br>there. I am no expert player of any of them, but I didn't notice any<br>strong bias toward the first or second player.<br><br><br>> And then someone may angrily demand to know, "Who cares anyway!?"  I<br>> do.  And I'm puzzled as to why other game designers contemptuously <br>> reject these standards. If you're only interested in creating <br>> flavor-of-the-month type games, then these standards<br>> of quality probably don't matter.  But I think most of us would like<br>> our games to be robust, and to stand up to years of increasingly <br>> expert strategy.  What's the problem?<br>><br>> Mark Steere<br><br>I agree that we should care about these qualities of an abstract<br>games. However you are mistaken if you think that these are the only<br>ones that matter or that no game can be excellent without them.<br>Chess, Shogi, Twixt and a multitude of others games have proven to be<br>excellent even if they aren't decisive or there is a first move advantage.<br><br>Maurizio</div>
