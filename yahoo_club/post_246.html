    <div>Anybody knows these game variants?<br><br>[Halma] <br><br>Top Secret: Each player drops in turns their 18 stones on the central <br>6x6 square area of the 16x16 board. Then, after all drops were made, <br>the goal is to be the first to remove all stones moving or jumping <br>over the board.<br><br>[Gomoku] <br><br>Give each player just 12 stones, and after the drop phase, where all <br>those stones are dropped on the board, the move phase begins: each <br>player moves one stone to an adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) empty <br>cell. Wins the player that makes a 5 in-a-row.<br><br>[Checkers]<br><br>(1)<br><br>Hide, is a 8x8 checkers variant, where each player starts with 8 <br>stones each, placed on the first 2 rows. Stones cannot capture nor <br>jump, but an isolated stone is removed from game. Wins the player <br>that makes the last move.=A0<br><br>(2)<br><br>In Board Draughts stones also cannot capture and just move and jump <br>forward, and the goal is to move all stones to the last row (where <br>they are removed from board). Wins the player with no stones left.=A0<br><br>(3)<br><br>Apparently, there is a game called French Checkers (anyone has more <br>historical info?) played as Draughts, except that soldiers can only <br>capture backwards.<br><br>(4)<br><br>Contract Checkers, is an variant invented in Chicago, 1934, played <br>like 8x8 Draughts, but each player has 2 more stones offboard, that <br>can be dropped on an empty cell on the first row, when the respective <br>cell on the last row is also empty.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
