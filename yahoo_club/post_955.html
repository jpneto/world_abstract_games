    <div>Box Hex is a Hex variant which plays exactly like Hex, except on a three<br>dimensional surface.  There are four shortest paths of connection: two<br>for each player.  This solves the strong first move advantage problem of<br>regular Hex, where you have only one shortest path, said path being<br>shared by both players.  (No need for the pie rule. )<br><br>Box Hex shares the topographic properties of regular Hex: one connection<br>must exist in a filled board, and opposing connections cannot exist<br>simultaneously.<br><br>Box Hex rule sheet <http://www.marksteeregames.com/Box_Hex_rules.pdf><br><br>Box Hex game board <http://www.marksteeregames.com/Box_Hex_board.pdf><br><br>I was planning to take a long break after Cephalopod, but I was so<br>inspired by Mark Thompson's Pentreca that I was compelled to jump in<br>again.  Box Hex is where the current carried me.<br><br>Mark Steere<br><br>Mark Steere Games <http://www.marksteeregames.com/><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
