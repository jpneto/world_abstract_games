    <div>After rereading Epaminondas and thinking more<br>about it I decided to revise the irreversible gain idea<br>a bit more. The idea is embodied in the rules<br>below:<br><br>1. Anbody who repeats a turn in a capture sequence<br>must announce the repetition after the turn. After<br>which the opponent cannot respond the same way as was<br>done before to any of the previous incarnation of this<br>turn in this capture sequence. So within a capture<br>sequence, the responses to every repetition of a turn must<br>be different. <br><br><br>2. The person that starts<br>and ends a capture sequence gets one stone toward the<br>fullfillment of their contracts. Otherwise no stones is<br>rewarded.</div>
