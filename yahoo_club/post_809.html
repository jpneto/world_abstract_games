    <div>> Mark Thompson's article 'Defining the Abstract' refers four <br>> qualitative features of abstract games: depth, clarity, drama and <br>> decisiveness. <br>> <br>> I would like your opinion to make a list of good and bad games <br>> concerning these features. I would like them to be easy to explain <br>> the rules as possible, and as known as possible.<br><br>I played Emergo (not Hex-Emergo) this weekend, against a player who<br>says it's his favorite game, and at one point felt I was losing. I had<br>a forced move, so I made it, and after what seemed like a short<br>sequence of forced moves it turned out I was pretty clearly winning,<br>which I ultimately did. (This proves that there is luck in abstract<br>games!) I'm pretty sure neither of us foresaw this, and so I'd guess<br>that Emergo, a good game, has some clarity problems.<br><br>But as someone has pointed out, your mileage may vary -- a game can<br>seem unclear only because a player hasn't grasped the strategic<br>principles yet, or else because he hasn't yet developed the facility<br>for the kind of visualization it requires. I could imagine that even<br>LOA could get clearer after playing it enough, if people tell me that<br>they experience it that way.<br><br>I remember once playing a game of Keryo-Pente in a "tournament" (there<br>were only two of us playing at one part in a larger meeting, but we'd<br>billed it as a tournament and there was a small prize), and both my<br>opponent and I seemed to be choosing moves that involved looking a<br>LONG way ahead. I remember thinking it was a really clear game, on the<br>ground that we would have been able to give at any point a long,<br>detailed, and clear explanation of why we judged the moves we made to<br>be the best ones. Of course, we could have been wrong, but at least we<br>didn't think we were feeling our way in the dark. I think that idea<br>was related to the fact that the board didn't change much in any one<br>move, as Ralf points out; this makes the visualization easier.<br><br>Mark</div>
