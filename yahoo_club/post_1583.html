    <div>New MSG Game: Hex Hex Y<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Hex_Hex_Y_rules.pdf<br><br>Hex Hex Y is the long sought "Y adapted to a hex hex board".  Maybe I cheated a little by coloring the sides.  :D  In February, 2008 I released a similar game called Starboard Y that turned out to be equivalent to Y.  Hopefully Hex Hex Y won't have that problem (or any problems).  It's thoroughly untested though, so hopefully it won't turn out to be a bummer for anyone. <br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
