    <div>That'a good point.<br><br>When testing out a new game it's always good to gauge how well it <br>resists obstructionist opponents intent on spoiling the game. If a <br>player can force a draw or infinitely delay defeat, then the game's <br>rules need some more work.<br><br>This is one aspect in which connection games shine. Most connection <br>games converge to a guarnateed win, so if a player makes negative <br>moves they will inevitably lose the game.<br><br>Cameron</div>
