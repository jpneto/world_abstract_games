    <div>Hi<br><br>This game seems a kind of Qubic (4x4x4 tic-tac-toe) which <br>was proved to be a 1st player win. It seems to me that<br>Time Vectors has more threath possibilities than Qubic,<br>implying (?) on an even greater first player advantage.<br><br>In your playtesting, what were the stats for 1st wins?<br>Any draws?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto<br><br>ps: you can play a game of Qubic at http://playqubic.com/ or <br>http://users.erols.com/ferrisbb/tictactoe.html</div>
