    <div>Hi all<br><br>I was going to stop my 'account' from recivieing emails as it was <br>getting ridiculous! My mouse was automatically going to 'delete' <br>whenever i opened a message; in a nut shell i think alot of this is <br>far too technical (dare i say anally retentive) for me. Please <br>excuse the spelling - i cant see any spell checker(or should i say <br>spell draught? hehehehe)on here. Anyway, i do have a topic that ties <br>up with this. Ive posted it on a couple games sites without reply so <br>i hope someone out there will be a little more polite & at least <br>give me their views; & it is this, "Why do we design?"<br><br>This is obviously only to fellow games designers like myself. I <br>sudjected this topic 'Reasons behind reasons'as i am asking why are <br>we designing in the first place? Is it to bring something new to the <br>table - literally - or is it for finacial reward? Are we designing <br>games that can be given as gifts, or are we designing gifts that <br>happen to be games? Me personally it is, i think, more the latter <br>than the former - i am in it for the money - but saying that I aim <br>to make the sales by inventing games that people want to play (hence <br>they offer something new). I am trying to design the new big thing, <br>aren't we all?<br><br>Which SELLS more; Chess or Monopoly? They both have their place & <br>they are poles apart, but which would YOU have prefered to have <br>invented? Please dont think im not serious about games designing, <br>but i know why im doing it - that in no way detracts from my drive <br>to drag the whole gerne forwards in my own little way.<br><br>Honest answers only please. Its only a game,but what a game it could <br>be! <br><br>P.s. is there a game where you play for a draw & if a player 'wins' <br>in the conventional sense, they lose as they ruined the draw? Yes i <br>do have a game with this in it (Yang-TE) where there is a <br>convenitonal winner, but if a draw happens (which is harder in some <br>ways than a clear win) then both players 'win' by the achivieng <br>of 'Immortality' (in keeping with the theme of the game).<br><br>Thanks & opologise for the spellings!<br><br>Colin</div>
