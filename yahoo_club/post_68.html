    <div>From a Gonnect game I'm playing with Joao, I<br><br>thought of a twirling way to move pieces over a<br><br>board. On the boards below, the squares marked <br>with<br>a '-' shows the possible destinations of <br>hite's<br>stone 'o'. Other stones on the same row or <br>column<br>play the role of pivots. They can be white <br>or<br>black, it doesn't matter. What matters is the<br><br>distance from the moving stone.<br><br>. . - . . ||| . . .<br>. . ||| o . . x .<br>. . . . . ||| . . - . . ||| .<br>. . . .<br>o . x . - ||| . o x - . ||| . . . .<br>.<br>. . . . . ||| . . - . . ||| . . . - .<br>. . - . .<br>||| . . . . . ||| . . . . .<br><br>There must be no<br>enemy on the diagonal path(s), <br>but maybe we may<br>allow friendly stones. Maybe <br>not. On the other hand<br>there can be any stones <br>between the moving stone<br>and the pivot, it <br>doesn't matter. Multiple twirls<br>using different <br>consecutive pivots are possible in<br>one move:<br><br>. . . . . . . .<br>. . . . . . .<br>3<br>. . . . 2 . . .<br>. . . 1 x 2 . .<br>. . . . 2 . .<br>x<br>. 1 . x . 1 . .<br>. . . . . . . .<br>. . . o . . .<br>3<br><br>But now I don't know what would be an original<br><br>objective. There could be captures, either on an<br><br>occupied destination square or, better, by a 360<br><br>degree twirl around an enemy. Well, as a start we<br><br>can have a Checker-like game with the objective<br><br>if capturing as many opposing stones as possible<br><br>(though they may not all be capturable in the <br>end).<br>But it would be nice to find something<br>else.<br><br>Hey, what if the winner was the first player who<br><br>manages to get a stone to twirl 360 degrees <br>around<br>itself? I mean, once the 'o' above can <br>reach the '3'<br>in the bottom, we might consider it <br>can uses<br>itself still on the origin square as a <br>pivot, a la<br>quantum interference! It wouldn't <br>result in a win<br>here because a full 360 degrees <br>twirl is not<br>possible due to the board edge.<br><br>Claude Chaunier</div>
