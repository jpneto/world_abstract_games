    <div>Most stacking games appear to be quite good, but some are very weak:<br><br>Ombagi<br><br>This is a Halma variant played with stacks. It was first published in <br>1981. The game was designed by Reinhold Wittig, a famous German game <br>inventor. He did a poor job. The same must be said of Andreas Keirat <br>the best known game tester in Germany who writes that Ombagi is quite a <br>good. This nonsense is typical for Keirat, and can be found whenever he <br>describes abstract strategy games. Ombagi has the same flaw as Halma: <br>just keep a few stones in your homebase, and your opponent will never <br>reach his goal. I'm a little bit tired of safing flawed games.<br>http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/txt/O/Ombagi.html<br>http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/txt/F/Fanorona.html<br><br><br>Colonne de Trois<br><br>Colonne de Trois is a simple children's game which was first described <br>in Jeux & Strat=E9gies in 1986.<br>After playing it several times, I believe it is a draw, but you must be <br>carefull!<br>http://jeuxstrategieter.free.fr/Colonnes_de_trois_complet.php<br><br>R</div>
