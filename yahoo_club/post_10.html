    <div>Universe is an old abstract game for 2-4 players.<br>It was marketed by Parker Brothers around the time<br>that "2001: A Space Odyssey" first came out, which was<br>1969 I think. The box features publicity stills from<br>the movie, including a shot where Frank the astronaut<br>is playing something that looks like Universe with<br>Hal, which you won't see if you watch an "edited for<br>TV" version, or if you blink at the wrong<br>moment.<br><br>Anyway, here are the rules for the 2-player version: the<br>board is a 10x10 grid of squares. Each player has a<br>collection of 12 pentomino shapes. If you've played Tetris,<br>you know what a tetromino is. A pentomino is 5<br>squares joined flush edge to edge. There are 12 pentomino<br>shapes, not counting rotations or reflections. The board<br>is empty to start. Players alternate placing one<br>piece on the board, aligned with the grid, so that 5<br>previously vacant squares are now filled. YOU MAY NOT "fence<br>off" any region of 1 to 4 squares with your move. For<br>example, If White starts by placing the + shaped pentomino<br>centered<br>on E5, the 2nd player may not place his +<br>shape<br>centered on G7, because that would fence off a<br>region<br>of 1 square at F6. One consequence of this rule is,<br>any region of 6 to 9 squares is a "dead zone" no one<br>may play in. The last player to move wins.<br><br>It<br>is unclear if the first move is an advantage or a<br>disadvantage, although it is possible to throw away the game on<br>the first move. If the first move occupies 1 or 2 of<br>the 4 central cells, the opponent can usually respond<br>by making the rotationally symmetric move. Once the<br>central region is closed off, the 2nd player will always<br>be able to respond symmetrically, and will therefore<br>win. This is called the "symmetric strategy." The<br>exception is if the first move uses the U-shaped pentomino,<br>it may be illegal to respond symmetrically, because<br>that would fence off two regions of 1 square<br>each.<br><br>So, here's the puzzle: suppose the board were 9x10<br>instead of 10x10. Now there are just two central cells<br>instead of four. The first move occupies 1 of the 2<br>central cells. The 2nd player replies with the symmetric<br>strategy as long as possible, and if this strategy becomes<br>impossible, the 2nd player would make the strongest possible<br>sequence of moves. Nevertheless, the 1st player wins the<br>game. How?<br><br>The font here is proportional, making<br>it difficult<br>to post a solution. Email me for the<br>answer at:<br>davidj@...</div>
