    <div>> ...the dispatch restricts the placements of stones: your <br>> next placement depends on where you drop your previous pieces, <br>> and in this point it's very different from a typical <br>> Go variant. You can secure a territory by preventing <br>> the enemy to dispatch a platoon inside it, you don't <br>> need two safe holes for that, like a true Go variant.<br><br><br>Exactly. It means that this additional rule (in addition to the rules <br>of Omino Go) results in simpler games, which has less tactical depth. <br>Two safe holes in order to be alive isn't itself a Go rule, but just <br>the logical consequence of Go rules. <br><br>What you do, is <br><br>(1) adding a rule (making the rules more complicated),<br><br>but at the same time  <br><br>(2) the game becomes less challenging<br><br>truthforum</div>
