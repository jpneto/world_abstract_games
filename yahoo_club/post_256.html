    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Yes, Trellis has done some evolving.  The original version, described <br>in June 2000 GAMES, took place on a 17x17 board (counting the <br>points), which was divided into four 9x9 quadrants (note that some <br>points belonged to two quadrants and the center point belonged to all <br>four quadrants).  Five games took place at the same time --- one in <br>each quadrant and one on the full board.  The object of each game was <br>to connect the top to the bottom (for Black) and the left to the <br>right (for White).  The person who won at least three of these five <br>games was the winner.  You played just one stone on your turn.<br><br>Shortly after publication I tried applying the quadrant idea to the <br>game Hex (i.e., Black tries to connect the upper right to the lower <br>left of each quadrant and the full board, and White tries to connect <br>the upper left to the lower right of each quadrant and the full <br>board --- three or more out of five wins).  I expected it to work <br>comparably well but was surprised --- it was considerably more <br>interesting, I thought.  (I think this results from the tension <br>between the two "acute" quadrants and the two "obtuse" quadrants).  <br>Not long after this I decided the tactics on the checkered grid could <br>use some spicing up.  This led to the idea to play two stones at a <br>prescribed distance apart.<br><br>So the original version of Trellis split into two games:  Square <br>Trellis (checkered grid, no quadrants, two stones per turn) and <br>Quadrant Trellis (rhombus board divided into quadrants, just one <br>stone per turn).  Both games were described in October 2001 GAMES.  <br>Since then I've chosen Square Trellis to be the standard game and <br>changed the name of Quadrant Trellis to Quadrant Hex, since it is <br>really a Hex variant rather than its own game.<br><br>Steve<br><br>--- In abstractgames@y..., markthomps <no_reply@y...> wrote:<br>> Hi Steve,<br>> <br>> Has Trellis evolved since the version published in the June 2000 <br>> GAMES magazine?
