    <div>Hi abstract gamers,<br><br>As many of you<br>probably know, I keep The World of Abstract Games<br>website<br>[www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv] where are, at this moment, 3 different<br>sections,<br>namely,<br><br>i) Go Variations;<br>ii) Games of Soldiers (i.e.,<br>games played with Go stones)<br>iii) Games of King and<br>Soldiers (i.e., games played with two types of<br>pieces<br>on two colors)<br><br>Since many of those games<br>(more than 60 in the last two sections,<br>and<br>couting!) are very easy to implement in Zillions (and many<br>of those were<br>already been programmed) I wonder<br>if there is someone interested in joining<br>the<br>effort to code as many games as possible, so that those<br>ZRFs (Zillion<br>Rule Files) could be accessed by<br>people through the net.<br><br>Please send me an<br>email,<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Pedro Neto</div>
