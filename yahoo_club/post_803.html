    <div>Hi,<br><br>> in LOA --> only two positions change (rather high clarity!)<br><br>I'd say that LOA does not have very good clarity at all. For every <br>move, you have to:<br><br>1) Count the number of pieces in the row/column/diagonal,<br>2) Make sure the destination point is that distance away, <br>3) Remember whether it was your pieces or your opponent's pieces <br>that you can jump over, then<br>4) Remember whether it was your pieces or your opponent's pieces <br>that you can jump over.<br><br>Admittedly 4) is obvious since you then capture the piece :) but my <br>point is that each move requires a signficant amount of mental <br>bookkeeping just to determine whether it's legal or not, which I <br>believe points to a lack of clarity.<br><br>Cameron</div>
