    <div>Hi Steve,<br><br>I think, I've now understood your standard rules. Many "non-standard" <br>variants are possible. I would like to call the following one the <br>Chinese variant because it bears resemblance to the Weiqi rules of Go:<br><br>"Chinese Orbit" is played on a board with 15x15 points. <br><br>An "orbit" is a chain of stones of one color (diagonally or <br>orthogonally adjacent) which is either connected to itself or to one <br>edge or to two adjacent edges of the board, encircling empty points <br>and/or opponent's stones. <br><br>After an "orbit" is formed any opponent's stones inside of it are <br>removed.<br><br>It is not permitted to play inside an opponent's orbit unless <br>an "orbit" is formed in the same move.<br><br>It is not permitted to repeat a board position in a Ko fight.<br><br>"Territory" is counted as follows: your own points inside your orbits <br>plus the number of your stones on the board at the end of the game. <br>The sum of all points equals the numbers of board points. "Seki" <br>(local stalemate) or drawn games are impossible.<br><br><br>TruthForum</div>
