    <div>> Do you know the game that is called "morpion solitaire"? <br>> I call it in my book connector (it has many names). <br><br>I never seen this puzzle. In your book, you translate the concept to a <br>game for 2, but I think the puzzle is more fun :-)<br><br>I tried the game and scored 76 (check <br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/blog/morpion76.gif) but I sense I wasted <br>better options. <br><br>What is the best known max score? Did you prove that there is a <br>strategy which permits a player to continue forever?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
