    <div>Mark, you're banned anyway as you continue to send me harrassing e-<br>mails (average: two or three hate mails per day). <br><br>BTW, the discussion in stacking-games has totally shifted away from <br>stacking games. It is mostly about non-stacking games (whether true <br>or pseudo doesn't matter in this case) -- and is basically the same <br>as the one in this group.
