    <div>Impressive playing fields!  <br><br>I especially like the GRYB field.  A truly interesting field with <br>lots of play potential. It got me to thinking of applying Chess to it.<br>Hmmmmmm...just how to define the moves of the pieces.  Definitely <br>have to create unique ones.<br><br>The 4x4x4x4 playing field of Time Vectors is cool.  I will be saving <br>my pennies for that one.  I already developed rules for 6D Chess <br>which need that particular field.  If you'd like the rules, I'll e-<br>mail them to ya.<br><br>Kudos.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@y..., "David Barnhart" <davidb@n...> wrote:<br>> Hello all,<br>> <br>> I have recently joined with the abstract games forum here.
