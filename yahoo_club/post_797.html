    <div>I had to dig around in the top of my closet to locate this game.  It <br>was printed up to look like the album cover for an LP record.<br><br>I remember playing lots of games with a few friends and we were not <br>that very excited about it.  There seemed to be something missing.  <br>The end-games just seemed to be inevitable.<br><br>We tried a variant in which the following was allowed:<br><br>1. If the player was able to form a triangle, they had to option to <br>move another stone of their own. Not an enemy stone.<br><br>2. If the player formed a square, they were able to move two enemy <br>stones.<br><br>And cascade of formations were allowed with rule 1.  So that if a <br>player formed a triangle then moved a stone which formed another <br>triangle then could move another stone.  This includes the formation <br>of a square resulting from such a move.  The only restriction being <br>forbidding repetition of position.<br><br>I know that this is only a slight modification to the original first <br>rule of triangle formation but it did liven the game up.  It also <br>meant that forming squares became a little difficult if the opponent <br>was sharp.</div>
