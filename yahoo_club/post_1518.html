    <div>>Thanks for posting that, Christian. Interesting reading. Still not a fan<br>>of Lasca? lol<br>><br>Hi Mark,<br><br>Nice meeting you and I'm glad you liked it. I hope I didn't sound too<br>polemic, because that's not in any way my intention. But of course I'm<br>serious about not taking Lasca quite seriously. It won't keep anyone<br>from playing it if he/she likes it, I hope. Anyway, I noticed some<br>presumptions about my work and my intentions and I thought it might be a<br>good idea to clarify what drove me. I'm no longer in 'competition' and I<br>appreciate your work as well as the many other abstracts that bloom<br>thanks to places like Little Golem, iG Game Center, Richard's PBeM and<br>other servers. It gives a chance to games that otherwise would have had<br>no future at all.<br><br>I see you're an animal lover. We just had a tragic loss when Misty died,<br>a week ago.<br><http://www.wasbeerhonden.nl/Mainpage.html><br>She apparently suffered from an inflammation of the uterus after mating<br>season. But she didn't actually look sick, just a bit slow. By the time<br>I noticed something was seriously wrong, it was too late. <br><br>Still got three raccoon dogs though, and a husky, a cat and a 12-foot<br>burmese python :)<br><br><br>cheers, and keep up the good work!<br><br><br>christian</div>
