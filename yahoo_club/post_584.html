    <div>Hello,<br><br>> I didn't buy a copy when I saw it in the local bookstore a few years<br>> ago, but _Complete_Mancala_Games_Book_ (ISBN 1569246831) looked very<br>> promising. <br><br>When I bought the book several years ago, it made me very happy. <br>However, after I checked the rules in many primary sources (the <br>ethnological literature) I became increasingly dissatisfied, because <br>probably more than half of the rules are explained incorrectly. <br>Moreover, Russ does not mention a single modern Mancala variant in <br>his "complete" games book. You'll find a collection of 35 modern <br>Mancala variants at  <br><br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/links/Modern_Mancala_<br>001076091057/<br><br><br>There must be more than 600 Mancala variants and I know the rules of <br>at least half of them.<br><br>Kalah is really an invented variant and was created by William J. <br>Champion (USA)in 1958. It is one of the few solved Mancala variants, <br>besides Dakon, MiniMancala, and Oware.<br><br>> http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/_T_mancala.htm<br><br>Ralf</div>
