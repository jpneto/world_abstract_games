    <div>>There are still several things which I don't understand:<br><br>>1. You say: "A player cannot make two consecutive sideway moves."<br>>But he is permitted to make two consecutive sideway piling moves or<br>>capturing moves or first a sideway move, then a sideway piling, then<br>>a sideway move ...? Isn't he?<br><br>Yes, but each piling and capturing is irreversible, they move the game<br>towards its end. Only allowing for consecutive sideways moves could<br>keep the game in an endless cycle.<br><br>>2. You say:<br>>" If a stack reaches the last row, (...) If it has prisoners, it<br>>restarts at the first row on that column, and all enemy tokens are<br>>removed."<br>>Although this might be very rare, it can happen that the square at<br>>the first row of that column is already occupied. What do you do in<br>>such a situation?<br><br>I never had that one. Perhaps then that move would be illegal.<br><br>>Could it also move backwards to pile up (on a friendly stack)?<br><br>Well, the rules as they are would say no. But the game itself is open<br>to changes. I only wanted to avoid tactics which prevent the end of<br>the game.<br><br>>BTW, did you try to play AP just on one color of a checkered board<br>>(e.g. 9x9 or 9x11; with nine pieces for each player)?<br><br>No, did you try it?<br><br>Jo=E3o<br><br>-----<br><br>Rules: http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/abpuluc.htm<br>=</div>
