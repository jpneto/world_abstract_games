    <div>>  Boardspace.net has just added it's 8'th game, Gobblet.<br><br>>  Gobblet is a deceptively simple game, played on a 4x4 board.<br>> The goal of the game is to make four in a row, but the pieces<br>> are "gobblets" that nest like Russian dolls.<br><br>>  There's a kick-ass robot player to show you the ropes.<br><br><br>Please review game "U!GB-JavaJack-Dumbot-2006-05-21-1644". The game<br>ended with neither player having 4 in row?<br><br>http://javajack.dynalias.net/boardspace/gameover.jpg<br><br>Alan</div>
