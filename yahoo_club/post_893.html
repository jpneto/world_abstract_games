    <div>Ralf, I welcome your interest and participation in the study of <br>Byte.  I have been playing Byte every day for just short of five <br>months, mostly at superdupergames.org.  My negative goal is to wring <br>out 8x8 Byte.  Roll up your sleeves and help me drive the strategy <br>forward.  Aloof, uninformed musings don't do a thing for me.<br><br>Preston<br><br>--- In abstractgames@...m, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "darkleer" <br>> <PrestonShleppenpepper@h...> wrote:<br>> <br>> <br>> aka "Freckles Z Deutsch", "Naryacanary", "Mark Steere", ...<br>> <br>> I will not comment on your shallow post. You confuse "stacking" <br>> with "stalking" and also many other things (obviously you're not a <br>> Christian, otherwise you wouldn't confuse GOD (the only person who <br>> ought to be "revered") with Christian Freeling).<br>> <br>> I will post the analysis of Byte at BoardGameGeek <br>> <br>> http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19360<br>> <br>> Best wishes,<br>> <br>> Ralph<br>></div>
