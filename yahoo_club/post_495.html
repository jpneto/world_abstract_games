    <div>I've been thinking about a new form of 3D Checkers, played on a <br>tetrahedral board like the one I used for Tetrahedral Chess (shown at <br><br>http://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest84/tetrahedralchess.html<br><br>) I would use a board with only six levels, hence 56 squares: 1x6 on <br>levels I and VI, 2x5 on levels II and V, and 3x4 on levels III and <br>IV. (See the image to get a better idea of why this forms a <br>tetrahedron.) I would also eliminate the coloring of the squares -- <br>probably make the board of sheets of clear plexiglas, marked with the <br>outlines of squares in black.<br><br>The centers of the squares of each level are exactly above and below <br>the corners of the squares on the adjacent levels. Therefore, each <br>square in the middle of the board has 4 nearest neighbors on the <br>levels above and below. These 8 squares, and the 4 orthogonal <br>neighbors on the same level, are the 12 squares adjacent to the <br>square. Those 12 directions are the directions in which a King can <br>move, for example.<br><br>I would fill the bottom and top two levels with men at the start of <br>the game, which would be 16 checkers each side. A man can move to any <br>adjacent square in the forward direction (up for Red, down for <br>Black), and can jump in any direction at all. Upon ending a turn on <br>the furthest level, a man is promoted to a king, which can move <br>without capturing any unobstructed distance in any of the 12 <br>directions, or can long-jump in any of the 12 directions. Other rules <br>would also resemble those for International Checkers.<br><br>I'm anxious to try it out, and interested enough in the idea to build <br>a board, though I'm busy with other things for a few weeks. Seems to <br>me this would be playable. The board is comparable in size to the <br>International Checkers board, and though the cells have much more <br>potential connectivity, most of them don't use all of it -- there are <br>actually only 4 cells in the middle of the board that would have the <br>full 12 adjacent neighbors, if I'm envisioning it correctly. I think <br>with a physical board to inspect it wouldn't be too mind-boggling to <br>play. Checkers may work better on this 3D field than chess.<br><br>(I'm also considering Tetrahedral Renju, but that would take a much <br>bigger board...)</div>
