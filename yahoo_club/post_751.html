    <div>Hi Dieter,<br><br>I feel the same, very sad, especially last night when I couldn't find sleep.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>>as far as I know, AG 17 will(?) have a focus on stacking games. That's<br>>why Kerry asked me to write about my game Accasta, too. Well, I wrote<br>>something down, he liked it and wanted to include it into the next<br>>issue. That's all I know. I'm still waiting and feeling very sad<br>>thinking of this great magazine.<br>><br>>Dieter Stein</div>
