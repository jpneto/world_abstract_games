    <div>I'm surprised you got 26 from pre-1990. I agree<br>that ZoG and the internet have led to an explosion.<br>The flip side is that designers in the dark ages<br>(pre-1990) did not have many outlets for their games, and<br>this both stifled creativity and left the few games<br>that were invented difficult to find. <br><br>Every<br>now and then I go to the US patent site and start<br>tracing game patent citations back through the ages. It's<br>the only place on-line I know of where you can find<br>original abstract game descriptions from as far back as<br>the 1800s. It will give you some sense of how game<br>culture has evolved over the years.<br><br>I think that<br>the idea of a boardgame has shifted in recent years<br>from a social medium, something that brings people<br>together across a table, to a solitary computer-based<br>experience. Not to say there are not social elements to the<br>current experience, just not as much.</div>
