    <div>Here are some traditional / old Draughts variants:<br><br>1.<br>Doppelte Dame<br>- invented by a German guy "F Zimmermann" in 1821<br>- same rules as English Draughts / American Straight Checkers<br>- White starts (isn't said in the Czech description, but that's a <br>  German law)<br>- board two boards side by side with the usual setup in Draughts<br>  --> http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/pics/dama07.gif<br><br>2.<br>Jeu de Dames Africaines<br>- from Western Africa <br>- board 9x9, 40 pieces each player<br>- White starts<br>- stones move one empty intersection forwards (diagonally or <br>orthogonally)<br>- a stone reaching the opponent's base row is promoted to a king<br>- kings may move as many intersections as are not occupied (in any <br>direction)<br>- men capture by the short jump in any direction<br>- kings capture by the long jump in any direction<br>- you must capture as many pieces as possible (the game was <br>influenced by the French)<br>- pieces are removed not before the move has ended<br>- board: http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/pics/a-dama.gif<br><br>3.<br>Kavkaz Dama<br>- from Chechnya<br>- different sizes are possible, try a board with 11x7 intersections <br>with 33 pieces each player (obviously the Czech description contains <br>several mistakes here)<br>- at the start only the central row remains free of pieces<br>- White starts (probably)<br>- pieces are moved forwards diagonally or orthogonally only one <br>intersection, must be free<br>- men capture by the short jump in al (up to 8) directions)<br>- no promotion (!), but pieces can still capture if they reach the <br>last row<br>- jumped over pieces are immediatly removed as in Turkish Draughts<br>- jumping is compulsory, make the move which captures the largest  <br>number<br>- winner: the player who moves last (obviously there is another <br>mistake in the Czech description, because there is always a player <br>who moves last)<br>- a draw is not possible<br><br><br>truthforum<br><br><br><br><br><br>> Sure. I just meant that if you have found a game or two that you <br>consider<br>> exceptional, it would be nice if it or they could start seeing wider<br>> circulation in English. There's certainly no rush and I don't mean <br>to put<br>> you on the spot. Thanks.</div>
