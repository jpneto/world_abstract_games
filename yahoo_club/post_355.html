    <div>truthforum:<br>> of Cislovane kameny. What is the strengths of the stones? <br><br>The large number in their center...<br><br>> Just the (4) number(s) at the edges?  <br><br>because those other surrounding numbers are written on the board,<br>not on the stones :^)  They only give you points when the game is<br>over and some stones of yours is on them.<br><br>> I think equally strong pieces are also permitted to capture<br>> each other.<br><br>Without playing, my impression is they are not. That seems<br>quite a natural interpration from reading this series of<br>sentences:<br><br>   "The stone that captures must be stronger (i.e.<br>    have a higher value) than the stone it captures."<br><br>   "Stones may block each others. [vede] only one way out<br>    of a blockade - namely, capturing a weaker stone."<br><br>(I don't understand "vede" in the last sentence).<br><br>Yes I'm French.  I didn't try any game there. These days<br>I'm helping a friend to get his computer to read the<br>International Phonetic Alphabet aloud.<br><br>Cheers!<br>Claude</div>
