    <div>Hi Clark,<br><br>> >1. Troll is considered a connection game by Browne, <br>> >while Gomullo is not.<br>> <br>> The aim of Troll is to connect both sides of the board; this is <br>> clearly a game with a strictly connective goal. <br>> <br>> The aim of Gomullo is to form a pattern of N pieces in a row; this <br>> is a pattern-based goal and not strictly a connection-based one.<br><br><br>As I pointed out, a row in Gomullo is always a connecton between two <br>opposite sites at the same time. What was first, the egg or the hen? <br><br>My solution: <br><br>Gomullo is both at the same time, Connection Game and N-in-a-Row-Game.<br><br>BTW, I think, "pattern" ist just another expression for "topology", <br>and territorial games, n-in-a-row games and connection games should <br>all be called "pattern-based" or "topological".<br><br>BTW, but perhaps I'm wrong, wasn't TwixT (correct spelling!) already <br>invented by Randolph in 1957 in the Vienna coffeehouse "Hawelka" as a <br>paper-and-pencil game?<br> <br>> Also, Gomullo involves the flipping of pieces surrounded in a line <br>> (again, a pattern) so it does not really involve connective play <br>> either.<br><br>The same is true for Troll which also involves the flipping of pieces <br>surrounded in a line.<br><br>Complete rules of Troll:<br><br>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/troll.html<br><br>I was surprised to read that the goal of Star should be something <br>else than to achieve connection(s). In my opinion, point scoring is <br>just a means to evaluate connections but not a goal by itself. The <br>goal of Go is still to make territory or rather territories which are <br>then compared and measured by a point scoring system. Again, I feel <br>that you unnecessarily complicate issues by insisting on <br>(one) "specific" connection as a goal. Point scoring is never a goal. <br><br>Ralf</div>
