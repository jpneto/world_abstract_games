    <div>Dear Everyone,<br><br>        Hello. Here's an idea or rather a theme that maybe of some <br>interesting:<br><br>        Imagine a game where the players accumulate points in some <br>way, and at the end the player with the higher number of points, <br>receive the points accumulated by the oponent. The two player than <br>switch sides and play again. the player that receive the greater <br>number of points win.<br><br>       In this game it is obviously not good to win by too much for it  <br>reduce one's own score. And worse if you lose. So when has to strive <br>for an almost tie where one is on top.<br><br>       This can obviously applied to Go. what other games can be made?<br><br>       Hope this inspires you<br><br>-Jianying Ji</div>
