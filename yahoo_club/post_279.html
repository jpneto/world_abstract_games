    <div>Wow, those are some obscure games!  True to form, I actually own two <br>of them.<br><br>> Stak.  Author: unknown. Publ: DMR Games. 1985<br>><br>The rules of Stak are about 5 pages, letter size, too long for here.  <br>If you email me with a postal address, I will photocopy a set for <br>you.  (I have no scanner.)<br> <br>> Matrix.  Author: unknown. Publ: Knots Games, 1979.<br>> <br>GAME ONE<br>Object:<br>To be the first to form a line of four differently colored chips. A <br>line consists of four spaces in either horizontal, vertical, or <br>diagonal directions. [The board is 4 x 4.]<br><br>To start:<br>Each player chooses 6 chips, three each of two colors. [The game <br>comes with 4 each of red, green, yellow, and blue disks.]<br><br>The play:<br>The players alternate in turn, placing one chip at a time on the <br>board.<br><br>Rules:<br>1. A chip cannot be placed adjacent to a chip of the same color.<br><br>2. Players cannot conceal their chips "in hand".<br><br>3. If a player cannot place a chip, he passes.<br><br>4. Players are in a tie if no one player has managed to form a line <br>of four different colors.<br><br>Winner:<br>The first player to complete a line of four differently colored chips.<br><br>Strategy:<br>Check your opoonent's remaining pieces to figure your moves. [Duh!]<br><br>GAME TWO<br>This game is the same as Game One with two exceptions:<br><br>1. Each player now chooses 8 chips each of two colors.<br><br>2. Chips of the same color CAN be placed in adjacent spaces.<br><br><br>John Lawson</div>
