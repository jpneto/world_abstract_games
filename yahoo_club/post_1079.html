    <div>Tumblingdown is a perfect abstract by many measures - it's<br>extremely simple, with vigorous and immediately obvious tactics.<br>Like yinsh, the play seems chaotic at first, but after a few<br>plays strategic patterns have begun to appear in my mind.<br><br>Tumblingdown has an interesting history.

It<br>won the competition, but seems to have been immediately forgotten.<br>It came to my attention when someone pointed out the similarity<br>of its move style to that of Exxit.<br><br>http://www.boardspace.net/tumble/english/rules.html<br><br>http://www.boardspace.net/english/about_tumblingdown.html</div>
