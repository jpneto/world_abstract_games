    <div>If you enjoy that variation, fine, more power to<br>you.<br>But I'm a little concerned about a trend I've noticed<br>in this club: almost every post talks about some new<br>abstract game, or some new variation on an existing game.<br>In fact, except for my original Universe post<br>(message 10), I didn't see a SINGLE post that talks about<br>an already "established" game.<br>If that's what<br>you're interested in, go for it! But I am curious: has<br>anyone actually tried to solve my puzzle? Would anyone<br>be interested in a solution? Like I said before, the<br>proportional font here makes posting a solution difficult. But<br>I could email a solution to anyone interested.<br>I<br>have a new email: twixt@...<br><br><br>Thanks<br>for your time!<br><br>David</div>
