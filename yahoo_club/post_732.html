    <div>Alternator is one of my favorites too.  It's a very unusual expression of<br>the territorial theme (and perhaps also of the connection theme), and it's<br>fun to play on as small of a board-size as 6x6.<br><br>I got the rules for Alternator from Greg himself.  I found the ruleset to be<br>counter-intuitive at first, but once I'd actually played it several times I<br>was delighted in the game.  Is there a description of Alternator somewhere<br>on the net?  If not, there should be.<br><br>Steve<br><br><br><br>----- Original Message ----- <br>From: "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@...><br>To: <abstractgames@yahoogroups.com><br>Sent: Sunday, April 03, 2005 10:59 AM<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] 100 Strategic Games - For Pen and Paper (Walter<br>Joris, 2002)<br><br><br><br>Book of the Month:<br><br>100 Strategic Games - For Pen and Paper<br>=======================================<br><br><br>This book was written in April 2002 by Walter Joris, a Belgium expert<br>on paper-and-pencil games. It covers 100 games invented by Joris (as<br>claimed by him), except a few traditional games which were adapted to<br>be played on paper. You won't find Dots & Boxes, nor its French<br>forerunner La Pipopipette (invented by famous mathematician Edouard<br>Lucas in 1889). Also, Alternator is not included, one of my<br>favourites invented by Gregory K. van Patten in the 1990s. Moreover,<br>many traditional games are missing, which can easily played on paper,<br>such as Tic-tac-toe or Renju. This isn't really a drawback because<br>you'll find many games, which might be totally new for you.<br><br>Mancala lovers will be surprised to find several Mancala variants:<br><br>1.<br>Joris' Awele (#86)<br><br>This is the same game as traditional Oware (Awele, Warri, etc.), just<br>a simplified version played on a 2 x 3 "board". In the paper-and-<br>pencil version counters are crossed out before they are taken out of<br>their basin and distributed. Mancala enthusiasts might be annoyed by<br>his final statement: "A disadvantage of the Mancala games is that<br>they can become rather drawn out."<br><br>2.<br>Tornado (#87)<br><br>Obviously a plagiarism as this game is almost identical to Cirk<br>(Corn� van Moorsel, 1998). It only differs in a slightly different<br>starting position.<br><br>3.<br>Canicas (#88)<br><br>A very interesting game which can easily be made far more challenging<br>by increasing the number of internal rows (within the "fields" =<br>holes) from 3 to 6 and using 11 holes, instead of just 6. I also<br>would permit two marbles to be dropped on the larger board in each<br>player's  first move, not just one. The game has a territorial<br>aspect, rather unusual for Mancala games.<br><br>4.<br>Rumba (#98)<br><br>Identical to La Tchouka (English: Tchuka Ruma), which was probably<br>invented by famous mathematician Henri Delannoy (discoverer of the<br>Delannoy numbers) in 1895 by transforming a Malay game to fit into a<br>mathematical problem. The sub-variant given by Joris is known as Le<br>Tchoukaillon, invented by V�ronique Gautheron in 1977.<br><br>Joris' book is very cheap (US$9.95 and Euro even less) which could be<br>an additional reason to buy it.<br><br>Ralf<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>      Yahoo!
