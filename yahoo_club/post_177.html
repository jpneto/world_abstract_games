    <div>Hmm. The gap between games with dice and games without might be <br>similar to, say, the difference between connection games and capture <br>games. No reason to be that picky. I feel there is still the concept <br>of perfect play in backgammon, summing up over all possible games <br>and players' strategies, sort of a modulo randomness that makes the <br>theory non random, sort of. Individual games of backgammon don't <br>look like the real thing you play, only a projection, much like <br>psychological factors should have nothing to do with real chess <br>theory. I took time to see that way, purist as I was too, but now I <br>see abstract games as encompassing backgammon, subject to a theory <br>having things in common with other abstract games, and some <br>particular things too as any other abstract games.<br><br>In other words, it's not like arguing on whether sociology is an <br>exact science or not. It's more like accepting physics or quantum <br>physics as an exact science. There can be something pure in physics <br>connected to mathematics, much like there is something pure in <br>backgammon connected to the notion of abstract games. And every <br>single games you agree is abstract looks more like backgammon and <br>physics, never reaching perfectness and encompassing alone the whole <br>field of mathematics or abstract games.<br><br>> It's arguable that the term abstract game could also <br>> include "themeless" strategy games like Backgammon<br><br>There's nothing more "themeless" in backgammon than, say, in go.</div>
