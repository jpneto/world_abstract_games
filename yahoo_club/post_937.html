    <div>This is to introduce a new connection game, Pentreca, which applies the<br>concept (from Caeth) of cells claimed by edge-majority, and the concept<br>(from Trellis) of resolving intersections where four cells meet by<br>parity (each player "owns" half of such bridges from the start of the<br>game)to a pentagonal grid. Pentagon + Trellis + Caeth = Pentreca.<br><br>I've put a GIF of a board in the Photos section. Two players, Red and<br>Blue, each having a pen that marks in his color, alternately color in a<br>single edge with their color. Whenever three edges in any pentagon have<br>been colored with the same color, that player also colors in the<br>pentagon. Pentagons in the same color are in the same group if they<br>share an edge (regardless of whether the edge they share is also colored<br>with the same color), or if they share a corner of the same color. The<br>object is to form a group that connects the edges of the board of your<br>color.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
