    <div>> BTW, but perhaps I'm wrong, wasn't TwixT (correct spelling!) <br>already <br>> invented by Randolph in 1957 in the Vienna coffeehouse "Hawelka" as <br>a <br>> paper-and-pencil game?<br><br><br>TwixT was really invented in 1957(/58?), the date is from Erwin <br>Glonnegger, one of the most well-known German game experts and former <br>head of Ravensburger. In 1998, there was a limited new edition of <br>TwixT in Germany to celebrate its 40th anniversary including copies <br>of the first recorded TwixT games played in the coffeehouse Hawelka <br>(still one of Vienna's famous meeting points for artists) between A. <br>Randolph and Herbert Feuerstein. I believe that Kosmos Games knew the <br>correct date for the anniversary. <br><br>http://www.brettspieltest.de/alphabetisch/Twixt/twixt.html<br><br>Ralf</div>
