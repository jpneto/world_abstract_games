    <div>> I don't think it's just a problem of my part (and of Cam's): LOA is <br>> hard to follow. If there is just one or two changed stones, many <br>other <br>> stones change their move range, since move is a parameter of the <br>board <br>> position. Folding that in two or three moves in the future, and even <br>> tactical plans become blurry.<br><br>No, that's not true. At the end of the game there is usually a clear <br>threat and not many ways to counter it. So even rather long endgame <br>problems appear to be common in LOA. In early stages it's not necessary <br>to consider every move as LOA is at this time very much a game of <br>position. The same is true for Go: You don't think about every move in <br>the Fuseki stage, but later -- in the endgame (Yose) or when you have <br>to find a tesuji (life & death, cutting, escape) you just consider very <br>few moves.<br><br>Ralf</div>
