    <div>Using an X/Y graph to play by mail.  The points on the graph are <br>considered exactly one quarter of a stone distant orthogonal.<br><br>Each placement of a stone is notated by its x/y coordinate on the <br>playing field.  This notation is always in increments of one-quarter <br>of stone.  Thus 1.00 is equal to one stone, 1.50 is equal to one and <br>one-half of a stone.   Stone are noted to occupy a point with their <br>centers and all measurements are made from the center of each stone.<br><br>The relation of one stone to another can be obtained by subtracting <br>the x/y coordinates one from another.<br><br>A stone is considered adjacent if it is locate on the following x/y <br>coordinates from any other:<br><br>0.00/=B11.00<br>=B10.25/=B11.00<br>=B10.50/=B11.00<br>=B10.75/=B10.75<br>=B11.00/=B10.50<br>=B11.00/=B10.25<br>=B11.00/0.00<br><br>It can never be located less than these from any particular stone, <br>and it can only be located adjacent no more than two distinct stones.<br><br>The following coordinates are the minimum needed for placing a <br>solitary stone, this is in relation to any stone on the field.  This <br>will allow that such placements result in a distance of one and one-<br>half stones between any other stone.<br><br>0.00/=B12.50<br>=B10.25/=B12.50<br>=B10.50/=B12.50<br>=B10.75/=B12.50<br>=B11.00/=B12.25<br>=B11.25/=B12.25<br>=B11.50/=B12.00<br>=B11.75/=B11.75<br>=B12.00/=B11.50<br>=B12.25/=B11.25<br>=B12.25/=B11.00<br>=B12.50/=B10.75<br>=B12.50/=B10.50<br>=B12.50/=B10.25<br>=B12.50/0.00<br><br>Such solitary placements can exceed these measurements, but will <br>never be less.<br><br>When the placement of a stone results in the capture of a string, <br>each coordinate for the stones of that string are noted in their <br>order of connection, including the coordinates of the other stone <br>which aids in the string capture. <br><br>Players should begin their coordinate system on the playing field <br>from the center.  If using a circular field, merely disallow those <br>coordinates which fall outside the arc.</div>
