    <div>I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon<br>style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.<br><br>The idea:<br>1. Players play to an agreed number of points, or a set number of<br>games (the player with the most points at the end wins the match). <br>Unless stakes are raised, players get 1 point each if game ends in a<br>tie.  Winner gets 2 points on a win, zero with a loss.<br>2. Points per game start at 2.<br>3. If player asks opponent to resign, and opponent agrees, then their<br>opponent resigns.<br>4. If opponent doesn't resign, then for game are doubled.  The player<br>who raised the stakes must win the game, in order to get the full<br>amount of new points.  If their opponent wins they game, then the<br>opponent gets a full amount of points.  If game ends in a draw,<br>opponent gets half the amount of new points (this is done to encourage<br>players to play for win).<br>5. Redoubling is permitted.  A player is only allowed to double or<br>redouble once, until their opponent agrees to redouble.</div>
