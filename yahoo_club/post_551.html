    <div>During some play-testing, an interesting form of capture was <br>discovered.  Allowing that stones may be played at any angle with <br>only two possible liberties for each, if a player places two stones <br>adjacent(by their lonesomes) then an opponent can remove their <br>liberties by playing so that their stone contacts both.<br><br>This also creates the potential of another live position involving <br>only three stones.<br><br>Another rule:  Stones must either be place directly adjacent another <br>or at a distance greater than the width of a stone.<br><br>This was to reduce arguments about whether a series of stones is <br>connected or not.  It makes such quite obvious.  And with the ability <br>to place stones at any angle, the various possible distances create <br>an interesting dynamic in the play.<br><br>Back to play-testing.  We're trying to see if gaining control of the <br>perimeter can give an advantage.</div>
