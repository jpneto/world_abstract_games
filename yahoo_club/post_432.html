    <div>markthomps:<br>> ... What I have in mind also begins with Cross<br>> moving to the center  (or any cell on the short<br>> diagonal), but after that it's quite simple: play<br>> symmetrically, the same color stone as Parallel,<br>> mirror- reflected across the short diagonal.<br><br>Ha!  Thought I'd tried all the symmetries, guess I should have broken out some physical stones and tried it.  Nice!<br><br>JPN's fix sounds interesting, as does your final one.  I'm not a big fan of the swapping rules.  It can lead to some weirdly cruel games if you're playing with someone else with a high level of deceit. ;-)<br><br>Thought about a game where sides aren't chosen immediately, but at some point in the game someone declares, but if players play the winning strategy for the board size they just call out on their turn.<br><br>What's the game like if the middle cel is simply non-playable?<br><br>Merle</div>
