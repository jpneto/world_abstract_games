    <div>> My comments were directed at the claim that Bombardment models the <br>> U.S. invasion of Iraq.  Your evidence was that blue missiles "could" <br>> be considered American and red missiles "could" be considered as <br>> representing Iraq, Iran, or North Korea.  You then tied this <br>> interpretation of the game to a version of Morris released in Nazi <br>> Germany featuring a swastika.  This is quite a stretch and I think <br>> unfair to the game designer.  <br><br>I just gave examples of games which had board designs related to their<br>historical / cultural background. I didn't compare Rautenm=FChle with<br>Bombardment, I just said, that both games are obviously related to the<br>time when they were born.  In regard to Bombardment, which was<br>released just a week or two before the Iraque war, the board design<br>and the pieces obviously mirror the public discussion going on about<br>Iraqui weapons of mass destructions and illegal missles. <br><br>Actually Bombardment is a good playable game, although the "theme" is,<br>in my opinion, a little bit tasteless.<br><br><br>> "Blue" is not a uniquely American <br>> color and "red" is not unique to the countries you cite. Both colors <br>> are commonly used in boardgames without any intention of designating <br>> a particular country.  <br><br>It might be true for some games that colors do not have much meaning,<br>but I doubt that it was just a conincidence in Bombardment. <br>90% of games still use white and black pieces which originally<br>symbolized either good and evil (in western games of enemy<br>extermination) or the Yin & Yang principle (in eastern games of<br>territorial coexistance).<br><br>> None of the so-called "axis of evil" <br>> countries have missiles that could reach the U.S. (okay, nobody <br>> knows for sure about NK), and at any rate none were fired by Iraq <br>> during the invasion.  The analogy simply doesn't work, which is why <br>> I assume you failed to mention it in your response. <br><br>My dear Dan, Iraque fired several missles at Kuwait during the<br>invasion. Sadly, this is a fact, not propaganda. And they even had<br>missles with a longer range than permitted. Whether this justifies the<br>assault on this country and the death of at least 21,000 Iraquis (or<br>as many as 55,000 - depending on which recent estimate you take) is<br>quite another question...<br><br>> Anybody who had concerns about the issue of the change in board size <br>> was free to ask me. Only one person did, long after the competition.<br><br>Paul Yearout wrote:<br><br>"We had a tournament. The opening is too long and too inconsequential.<br>There are many sequences of moves any of which could produce the same<br>configuration prior to actual contact with oppsing forces. I found<br>that a little dull. (...)"<br><br>AG, Issue 9, Spring 2002, page 2.<br><br><br> <br>> (...) slowly -- to your opinion but I have trouble finding human <br>> opponents on 7x7.  <br><br>Breakthrough is actually an elegant game. The rules are very simple,<br>yet it offers a wealth of combinations which is still true for 7x7. <br>BTW, you could play your game on a Tori Shogi board.<br><br><br>> I don't find the board size history particularly relevant to the <br>> issue of game play. The criticism of 8x8 seems to be that openings <br>> are inconsequential because they lead to a narrow set of mid-game <br>> positions. <br><br>No, the criticism was directed at the lengthiness of the opening, some<br>players think it takes too long to get to the Middle Game battles.<br><br>> I've neglected Alta and need to go back and try it on a larger board <br>> as you suggest.<br><br>Alta is a fascinating game and should be played tournamentwise. In my<br>opinion, it's one of the best connection games. Why not find a<br>publisher? If you have nice looking pieces and a quality board, the<br>game becomes an aesthetic pleasure too. I usually play it, I think, on<br>85 squares. <br><br><br>Ralf</div>
