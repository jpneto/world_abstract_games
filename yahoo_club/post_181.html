    <div>> I fully agree with you. Your argumentaion is the only logical one. <br><br>Thanks! Of course, what we're all arguing about is the definition of <br>a term, so I see it as an informal poll to everyone who comes here on <br>the question, "What did you expect to see discussed on this forum?" I <br>think it's interesting that there was no discussion of backgammon-<br>like and dominos-like games here (that I recall) until I posted a <br>note pointing out that these are not "abstract" games.<br><br>> or the game would end in a draw: <br><br>Oops! Actually, there's another possibility I forgot: the game could <br>go on forever, as games of "the L-Game" and "Chung Toi" always seem <br>to do, between attentive players.<br><br>>This is proven for Oware and Teeko, <br>> almost proven for 9-Men's Morris (Ralph Gasser didn't use the <br>> official rules of the World Morris Federation) and English Draughts.<br><br>Hmm, it's proved for all abstract games -- trivially, I think! But <br>you must mean that for these games it's been proved which of the <br>outcomes (1st player, 2nd player, draw) will occur with best play on <br>both sides? That's interesting ... so Oware has been "solved"?</div>
