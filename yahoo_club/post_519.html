    <div>> <br>> About 700 people are held at Gitmo on suspicion of involvement with <br>> al Qaeda and the Taliban.  <br><br>They are hold because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>They are hold to make the American public believe that your government<br>is doing something against terrorism, not because they are personally<br>guilty.<br><br><br>> The U.S. is relying on the notion that <br>> they are wartime "enemy combatants" outside the protection of the <br>> Geneva Convention because they are not members of a regular army.  <br><br>I know. But you also know that the Taliban ruled Afghanistan (at <br>least 90% of the county) and, for that reason, the Taliban fighters<br>were de-facto members of a "regular" army.<br><br><br>> This reasoning has also been applied to U.S. citizens, who normally <br>> enjoy constitutional protections.  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed <br>> yesterday to review the status of these prisoners. <br><br>I know. They do it in 2004. I am just afraid they decide again<br>according to their membership-book (mostly Republican), and not<br>according to what is just and right.<br><br><br>> It still isn't Dachau, though, even in 1935, and <br>> obscuring the differences doesn't help your argument. <br><br>In 1935 I would have preferred Dachau over Guantanamo Bay. At this<br>time you had still a reasonable chance to be released (a distant<br>relative of mine was in a concentration camp, but was released and<br>even became the director of a brewery again), you had contact to other<br>prisoners all the time (while in Guantanamo Bay you suffer "isolation<br>torture") and you had far more space to move around (not just 5 square<br>meters). At this time there were no mass executions and no gas<br>chambers in Dachau. You cannot obscure the fact that Guantanamo Bay is<br>a shame for a nation which claims to honor freedom and human rights.<br><br>Ralf</div>
