    <div>Hello all.<br><br>The basis of the doubling cube was myself pondering how to make<br>abstract strategy games more entertaining to watch on TV.  Besides<br>getting big stakes out there, figuring how to make an abstract<br>strategy game watchable on TV would help a lot to advance the games. <br>There are the basics that need to be done:<br>1. Reality TV series packaging and play editing.  You edit out the<br>dull parts to focus on the key points.  <br>2. Having games repackages (see 2) as narratives rather than just<br>games played, so people are watching a battle between two or more<br>people, people they can relate with and root for.  It is this<br>narrative that goes out and captivates people who aren't into games. <br>Due to reality series and the pocket cam, poker was able to achieve this.<br>3. Have sufficiently large and significant stakes so that people<br>believe something important is being played over.<br><br>These elements are basics that need to be done to make them watchable.<br> Abstract strategy games have several other challenges that need to be<br>done.  These, as I see it, are:<br>1. Having a good amount of surprise element that is understandable to<br>people who don't follow games.  I suggest the doubling cube as a way<br>to fix draw issues with chess, but it also offers a surprise element<br>that transcends the games and make them of interest to people who<br>don't follow the games.  One thing about abstracts (pure abstracts in<br>particular) is that you can remove the players and the game play out<br>itself.  This makes good, post-game analysis, and good for people to<br>Monday Morning Quarterback.  But, during watching, it makes for dry play.<br>2. The pacing of moves should be more uniform, for both the people<br>watching, and also to run commercials. What kills chess on TV is<br>waiting 15 minutes at times.  Other times, there are in a flurry.  Too<br>slow causes people to get bored who don't watch.  If it is too fast,<br>you don't have enough time to get people up on what is happening in<br>the game.  To this end, I would suggest a per-turn time limit, that<br>requires players to make moves.  This time pacing should enable<br>commentators following the game to get people up on the nuances of<br>what is going on in the game, for people who don't watch.  En passant,<br>castling and so on are explained in this, along with the names of<br>lines of play and their consequences.  It also gives the announcers<br>time to get the gravity in situation in place, to help with the narrative.<br><br>To get extended time for a turn, you allow a player two things, time<br>outs and also an extended turn.  Players get up to three additional<br>time blocks to make a move in.  If they use up their time blocks, they<br>can lose the game.  You also give them one or more time outs.  In<br>this, a player can call time and take a break to analyze a situation<br>(time limits are also set).  This also gives people a set chance to<br>take breaks also, and acts as a surprise.  What is done here is keep<br>the game the same, but change the way timing is handled in a game.<br><br>So, as I see it, to sum up, there are several elements that need to be<br>addressed with abstract strategy games to make them watchable on TV:<br>1. A narrative that transcends the game, that those who don't play the<br>game can follow and get interested in.<br>2. An ability to have people quickly be able to understand what is<br>going on in the game, to follow the narrative.<br>3. Have the pacing of the games be such that they hold interest, so<br>people watching neither get bored, nor do they get lost.<br>4. Package it so that it captivates people who don't play.  You hold<br>their interests throughout, and then they can go back and do analysis<br>on their own and see if they could second guess what happened.  End<br>result is you get buy in.<br>5. Have the games be about the players and their struggles, rather<br>than the positions on the board.  People like to root for and follow<br>players, rather than people.  If the games can be about the players<br>and their decisions, that counts.  Positions on the board is still<br>show of interest to people who play the game, but not people who<br>aren't new to the game.<br><br>Anyone have any other idea?  I would say it comes down to being able<br>to tell a sufficiently compelling story with each game, that people<br>can be able to follow it.  Done right, you can make nearly anything<br>watchable and enjoyable.  They manage to make sports drafts events on<br>television by following this.</div>
