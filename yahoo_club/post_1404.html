    <div>This may seem trite, but I think one of the key features of whatever <br>variant arises to unstick Chess is that it will be a "usual-equipment" <br>variant.  That way, people can try it out, toy with it, and settle on <br>the evolved rules gradually, and without commitment.<br><br>I personally have a fondness for Ralph Betza's Chess with Different <br>Armies, about which there was considerable discussion on <br>chessvariants.org a few years ago.  Ralph defined four specific <br>armies, but many people came up with experimenal armies, and trying <br>them out against one another was a lot of fun.  If such <br>experimentation propagated across the general chess-playing <br>population, change might be swift.</div>
