    <div>> But, imagine a variant of Chess 960<br>> in which each player has his own random initial arrangement, not<br>> necessarily equal to his opponent's initial setup.  Or you could take<br>> it one step further and give each player a random number of queens. <br>> You'd have a virtually guaranteed win if you got three queens and your<br>> opponent didn't get any.<br><br>Well, yes, you would be. But it would be an abstract game nonetheless.<br>Abstract games are not necessarily balanced, nor are they necessarily<br>interesting. Fox and Geese is an abstract game, as is Tic-tac-toe. And<br>Chess played with a handicap is an abstract game. An abstract game is<br>one in which each player has perfect information for all of his<br>decisions. We usually express this concept by saying "no random<br>elements" because we're explaining the notion to people who are used<br>to thinking of games like Backgammon or Candyland or whatever, but the<br>key concept is that players make their decisions without evaluating<br>any kind of probability.<br><br>Suppose the two players decided, deliberately, to play any particular<br>one of the 960 variants. Surely you would agree that the game they<br>play would be an abstract game, being simply a chess variant? But you<br>feel it would not be abstract if they decided at random which one of<br>the 960 variants to play? Isn't that a little odd?<br><br>Suppose you and I decided whether to play Dipole or to go out for<br>beers by tossing a coin, and it came up for Dipole. Would that game of<br>Dipole not be an abstract game? (heh)<br><br>Mark</div>
