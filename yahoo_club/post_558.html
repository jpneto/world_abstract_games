    <div>I experimented with a minigame involving 31 and 30 stones.  In general I<br>like the free-flowing feel and the idea of a "completed loop," but I need<br>some clarification:<br><br>I'm assuming that "suicide" is illegal, yes?  But that it IS legal to take<br>away your own last liberty(ies) if you're in the process of capturing an<br>opponent group (the "right of way" rule in regular Go)?  And is the ko rule<br>in effect here?  It would seem that ko fights would be significantly more<br>commom in 1-D Go than in 2-D Go, correct?<br><br>Regarding attaining the primary winning condition (place your last stone<br>without reprisal), I don't see any clear strategic guidelines for play.  Is<br>there something I'm missing, or is it mostly a tactical affair?  The<br>secondary winning condition (have the most stones on the board) seems more<br>concrete.<br><br>It's an interesting idea that a stone can have two liberties with their<br>angles being irrelevant.  Or more accurately, their angles are irrelevant<br>locally but are relevant globally because of a string's ability to loop back<br>on itself and thereby be "completed."<br><br>It may be possible not to have to fuss with the stone-width measurements.<br>The placement rule could be that either a stone is placed directly adjoining<br>an existing string or that it is placed as a string of one.  Of course this<br>would then necessitate a special rule governing under what conditions two<br>strings can be joined and a special rule governing under what conditions a<br>string can join itself (become a loop and thereby complete).  Perhaps there<br>could also be a rule governing under what conditions an uncompleted string<br>could be "split."<br><br>You may also want to do some experimenting with the capturing mechanics.<br>Go-like mechanics are certainly one possibility, but perhaps there are<br>others? String Go seems like a fun idea to play around with.<br><br>Steve<br><br>----- Original Message ----- <br>From: "interrupt27" <llsmith@...><br>To: <abstractgames@yahoogroups.com><br>Sent: Sunday, April 18, 2004 12:43 PM<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: A continuous 1-D go game<br><br><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Steven Meyers" <swmeyers@f...><br>> wrote:<br>> > This sounds like it might be fun to try out.

I was just working up a TXT file of the rules.  Of<br>> course, it is just the "bare bones" rules and does not include any of<br>> the tactics.<br>><br>> --------start of file-------------<br>><br>> STRING GO<br>><br>> Equipment:  A standard set of Go stones, 180 Black and 181 White.<br>><br>> The playing field is an open area of between 20 and 30 stones across.<br>> It is not necessary that the area be of any particular shape, round<br>> or square.<br>><br>> Each player, beginning with White, places a stone on the field under<br>> the following restrictions:<br>><br>> The stone must be directly adjacent to another stone.<br>>                   -or-<br>> The stone is one and one-half stone distance, or more, from any other.<br>><br>> Each stone is consider to have exactly two liberites.  These<br>> liberties can take place anywhere along their circumferences.  Thus<br>> no stone will ever have more than two stones adjacent.  No stones on<br>> the field may be moved to place another, there must be sufficient<br>> space to make a placement.<br>><br>> A stone or series of stones which have had all their liberties<br>> removed by opposing stones are removed from the field and returned to<br>> their owner for subsequent play.<br>><br>> Players may merge the end of strings, but not cross them.  A player<br>> is allowed to form a continuous loop of their own stones.  This is a<br>> completed string and is no long subject to play.<br>><br>> The player who is able to place their last stone, without the<br>> opponent immediately preforming any captures, wins.  If the position<br>> occurs where no stones may be legally placed, the player with the<br>> most stones on the field will win.<br>><br>> ---------end of file--------------<br>><br>><br>> I hope that this is sufficient.  Let me know if there needs to be<br>> clarification.  Also, let me know if there appears any serious<br>> problems with the play.  Further adjustments to these rules may prove<br>> necessary.<br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>> --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>------<br>> Yahoo!
