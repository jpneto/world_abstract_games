    <div>>Unfortunately, due to both the small board size and the clarity of the<br>>game, computers have been unbeatable since early on.  To increase<br>>depth, perhaps we should consider a larger board with multiple initial<br>>islands, say 13x13 with four islands or 19x19 with nine.  Ouch :-)<br>><br>>-- William Chang (Saratoga, CA)<br><br>What about re-introducing the original Reversi rule and permit the first <br>player to put two stones on the center squares, followed by the other player <br>putting the other two stones there. This would double the number of possible <br>games. Actually this was already suggested in the World Game Review a long <br>time ago, wasn't it?<br><br>Ralf</div>
