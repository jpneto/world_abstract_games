    <div>I have been playing partial games of TWOG over a<br>quarter of my Go board. It makes a good 10x10 arena. I am<br>playing it toidally ie the sides wrapback on themselves.<br>Some very interesting tactics have came out of it.<br>They are all seemed to be guided by the pricipal of<br>channeling, that is one tries to channel your opponent's<br>moves. It reminds me of the martial art cliche of<br>turning back the opponent's energy against it.<br><br>Two<br>tactics seems to stand out right now, though I'm sure<br>there are many, many more undiscovered ones. They are<br>veiled threats and capped groups. The following sample<br>will illustrate the principles:<br><br>O=blank<br>intersection<br>B=black piece<br>W=white<br>piece<br><br>OOOOOOOOOOj<br>OOOOOBOOOOi<br>OOOOOWOOOOh<br>OOOOOWBOOOg<br>OOWOOOOOOOf<br>OOWOOBOOOOe<br>OOBOOOOOOOd<br>OOOOOOOOOOc<br>OOOOOOOOOOb<br>OOOOOOOOOOa<br>1234567890-><br><br>e6 is a veiled threat on e3. If white puts a piece<br>on e5, d6, f6, e7, then black will pounce on e3<br>because then the piece on e6's range will change from 4<br>to 3 and e3 will be in range. Similarly h6 is a<br>veiled threat against e6 which prevents black from<br>putting pieces on h5, g5, f6, h7.<br><br>d3 caps the<br>group at e3 and f3. which prevents white from extending<br>the group to g3 because then d3 would capture g3.<br>Also it prevents white to place pieces at d2, c3, and<br>d4, for similar reasons.<br><br>At this point in the<br>game there is escapes from these dilemmas but as the<br>game goes on it will become more and more difficult,<br>and the one that lay the best traps and can best<br>redirect the opponent surely would win</div>
