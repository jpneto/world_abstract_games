    <div>I was thinking about a mix between Alak and Continuous-Go. The game <br>is played at a line segment and players drop circular stones with <br>radius R at any empty space of length 2*R.<br><br>- Two stones are connected if their centers have a distance lesser <br>than 4*R. <br>- A liberty is an empty segment with at least 2*R. <br>- Based on these definitions, the GO rules apply. <br><br>Variant: stones with different radiuses.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>Joao Neto<br><br>============================================================<br>Alak:          http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Alak.html<br>Continuous Go: http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/boards.htm#continuous</div>
