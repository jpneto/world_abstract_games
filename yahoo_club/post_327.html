    <div>Hi TruthForum,<br><br>I don't have the book on hand to double-check, but I'm pretty sure Rosette was described in R. Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games.  (It's probably in the section under Go variants.)  I've tried it, it's a nice game.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: truthforum2001 <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Friday, November 08, 2002 4:44 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Rosette - Need your help!<br><br><br>  Hello,<br><br>  does anybody know the size (how many hexagons) of the Rosette board <br>  (the game invented by Mark Berger)?<br><br>  Abstract Games wrote the game was invented in 1973, Christian <br>  Freeling and Joao Neto are writing that the game was invented in <br>  1975. What is correct?<br><br>  Hope you can help me,<br><br>  truthforum<br><br><br><br>  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br>  abstractgames-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br><br>  Your use of Yahoo!
