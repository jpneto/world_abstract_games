    <div>Nobody denies that in many Mancala games moves are carried out<br>simultaneously.  The debate was over the common interpretation of the phrase<br>"simultaneous game" and related concepts.  A simultaneous game is defined as<br>one in which on a given turn both players commit to their move<br>decisions *without either revealing their move to the other* before the<br>moves are carried out simultaneously.  The moves aren't necessarily decided<br>at the same time. But one player doesn't have knowledge of the other<br>player's move decision before he makes his own move decision.  This is the<br>scientific definition provided by game theory as well as the common usage<br>definition.<br><br>Then along comes Ralf with his game 55Stones in which one player, Sente,<br>informs the other player, Gote, of Sente's move decision before Gote has<br>decided on his own move decision.  55Stones is therefore *by definition* not<br>a simultaneous game.  Yet Ralf demands that the members of an<br>abstract gaming group accept Ralf's altered definition of simultaneous game<br>which now *does* allow one player to know of the other's move decision<br>before making his own move decision, a definition which directly<br>contradicts, which is diametrically opposed to, and which would therefore<br>totally invalidate the long and well established existing definition of<br>simultaneous game.  All of this to accommodate Ralf's desire for his own<br>game to be considered a simultaneous game.  When Ralf was properly ridiculed<br>by several members of Super Duper Games for his buffoonish behavior, Ralf<br>stepped up the rhetoric claiming that he was being persecuted by<br>missionaries who only tolerate one religion.  As though game theory was one<br>religion and Ralf theory was an equally valid religion.  It was never<br>religion vs religion.  It was science vs pseudo science.  It was the real<br>world vs Ralf World and Ralf World predictably collapsed in the cold light<br>of day.<br><br>Sometime during the melee, Ralf accused someone named Cohen of being<br>incorrect for properly conducting a discussion within the confines of game<br>theory.  You see Cohen didn't acknowledge Ralf's ridiculous assertions in<br>his discussion.  Nobody, including Cohen, is obligated to acknowledge Ralf<br>theory when discussing game theory.  If you want to modify game theory, you<br>publish an article in a journal, have it be peer reviewed, and you go<br>through the proper channels.  You don't show up at an unsuspecting gaming<br>forum and try to railroad your cockamamie theories into reality with<br>bluster, belligerence, and hysterical temper tantrums.<br><br>Ralf was first ejected from the forums at Super Duper Games, and was later<br>justifiably ejected from SDG altogether after launching and maintaining a<br>massive smear campaign against the owner of SDG.  Ralf is now contacting<br>various members of SDG personally and regaling them with his nauseating<br>account of self pity and victimization.  Ralf's favorite analogy is the<br>victim who notifies the policeman of his victimization and then is further<br>victimized by the policeman, a typical delusional construct in Ralf World.<br>A much more accurate analogy of Ralf's behavior would be a man standing up<br>in church with a bullhorn and launching into a tirade about how he saw<br>someone pinch a dollar from the collection plate and berating the pastor for<br>not kicking the suspect out of the church, and continuing to rant and rave<br>through his bullhorn until finally being ejected from the church.  And then<br>telling whoever would listen that he was victimized by the church.<br><br><br>On 11/20/06, Ralf <peace_panther@...> wrote:<br>><br>>   Many mancala games in Africa and southeastern Asia are started<br>> simultaneously.<br>><br>> There is even one game called Agsinnoninka played by the Iloko tribe<br>> in the Philippines in which all moves are performed simultaneously.<br>><br>> H. J. R.

One starts with three stones in each<br>> pit. Then each player removes whatever number of stones he decides<br>> from whatever holes he likes, on his own side. At this point each<br>> player has the remainder of the counters in his hand. Then each player<br>> places whatever number of them he decides in any one hole on his<br>> opponent's side. This could be considered to be move two of the<br>> "opening" phase of the game. Once this has been done both players<br>> simultaneously sow the stones remaining in their hands starting from<br>> the far left hand end of the opponent's side. (This is at each<br>> player's right.) The sowing is done counter clockwise. The moves chain<br>> in the same way as in mweso. This simultaneous move may be considered<br>> as move three of the opening phase. Captures are permitted during this<br>> three of this phase. The first player to sleep while carrying out this<br>> racing move begins the "execution" phase."<br>><br>> A move can be considered to consist of two parts:<br>><br>> (1) a mental process, in which one option is chosen among many<br>> ("decision-making")<br>><br>> (2) a physical process, in which the counters are distributed ("sowing")<br>><br>> I was a member of the jury of the "Simultaneous Game Design<br>> Competition". Most games that were submitted to us had specific rules<br>> to guarantee that the decision-making is also done simultaneously,<br>> usually by writing down a certain move before it is executed on the<br>> board. However, I never found (as far as I can remember) any rules in<br>> traditional mancala games which would guarantee that the moves are<br>> really chosen independently of each other. And, while the speed of a<br>> move is usually described as a matter of dexterity, sowing more slowly<br>> can be in Sungka based on the decision to capture the contents of a<br>> specific hole.<br>><br>> Many traditional mancala games are played in societies which have no<br>> writing systems and no notation to write down games (sometimes some<br>> holes have specific names, but I've never heard that these names were<br>> used in a notation system). So, it would simply not be possible in<br>> many societies to decide for a certain move and then to communicate<br>> this decision simultaneously to an opponent. For this reason, it is<br>> hardly surprising that the ethnologists who wrote about mancala never<br>> mentioned any simultaneous decision-making process, and yet described<br>> the play as being "simultaneous".<br>><br>> This was long before the advent of game theory. If we would find out<br>> what is really happening in the mind of these players, I believe at<br>> least in Sungka and Congkak, we would probably see that the<br>> decision-making is sequential (that is, one person is reacting to the<br>> decision of the other within a second or two much like in a Blitz game).<br>><br>> I'm not insisting that one definition should be prefered over the<br>> other, I'm just claiming that the ethnographic view which simply<br>> describes what's happening on the board (and can be observed) is just<br>> as good as any other definition of "simultaneous play". As ethnography<br>> today also researches contemporary culture including American and<br>> European cultures (my academic discipline is called "cultural<br>> studies", "people studies", "cultural anthropology", "culturology",<br>> and "European ethnology" depending on the university in Germany), this<br>> ethnographic view could also be extended to modern mancala games, such<br>> as 55Stones or Balduman's mancala.<br>><br>> It's up to psychologists to research the decision-making process in<br>> traditional games with simultaneous play, e.g. by filming the players<br>> and their actions in slow motion, analyzing their eye movement, and<br>> measuring the time involved in a "simultaneous" move with a clock.<br>><br>> Ralf<br>><br>> ----------------------------------------<br>><br>> Below I give a discussion on SDG which was later manipulated by<br>> removing all posts of one party:<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> Ralf, I've been studying the rules to 55Stones, and I have some<br>> comments to make, if you will indulge me. I don't know who Cohen is,<br>> but I agree with his statement, "Simultaneous play is a strict subset<br>> of games with hidden information."<br>> 55Stones is not a counterexample to that assertion because 55Stones is<br>> not a simultaneous move game. Even though the stones are sown in<br>> synchrony, each turn is initiated by the selection of one cup by one<br>> of the players. 55Stones is a turn based game.<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> Your statement is neither exact nor correct.<br>> Each move consists of two parts:<br>> (1) decision-making<br>> (2) execution of the move<br>> Cohen didn't specify any of these parts of a move so his statement<br>> must be (according to logic) taken as a general claim related to both<br>> (or all) components of a move.<br>> 55Stones has non-simultaneous (or turn-based) decision-making, but<br>> simultaneoues playing (moving). In fact, 55Stones would have fully<br>> qualified as a candidate for the Simultaneous Game Design Competition,<br>> of which I was a member of the jury!<br>> Now let's take a look at some traditional mancala games with<br>> simultaneous moves. Many African and Asian games start with a<br>> simultaneous opening. If you take a closer look, however, the more<br>> intelligent player waits a moment longer before he choses a pit,<br>> because it will give him a great advantage. This is actually the very<br>> reason that these games have remained children's games in Indonesia.<br>> So, these games have no simultaneous decision-making in real life, and<br>> yet their opening move is called "simultaneous" throughout the English<br>> anthropological literature, simply because it is performed<br>> simultaneously. Nobody ever claimed that the decision-making in these<br>> games is simultaneous.<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> The term "move" must have originated with games such as Chess and<br>> Checkers in which the taking of one's turn was accomplished by<br>> actually moving pieces. "Move" has since been generalized to mean the<br>> taking of one's turn. For example, moving or making one's move in<br>> Copolymer consists of coloring in a circle. Nothing is actually moved.<br>> Leaving aside the red herring that is Cohen for the moment, the flaws<br>> in your logic are as follows. You are interpreting the term "move" as<br>> the component of your turn in which pieces are actually moved, whereas<br>> your move is, in common parlance, the execution of your turn.<br>> Your claim that that since not all components of your move are turn<br>> based then 55Stones must be a simultaneous move game is fallacious.<br>> Conversely, since you are proffering the premise that 55Stones is a<br>> simultaneous move game, then players' moves (i.e. execution of their<br>> turns) should be entirely simultaneous, which they're not.<br>> More than just not being a simultaneous move game, 55Stones is in fact<br>> a turn based game. The only decisive portion of your move is the first<br>> part in which you select a pit, something which happens in turn. After<br>> the pit selection, the remainder of your move plays out automatically,<br>> or by algorithm. It's not like you can select a pit and then vary how<br>> the rest of your turn is going to play out. Your move is entirely<br>> determined by your pit selection - something, as I said, which happens<br>> in turn.<br>> I don't want it to seem like I'm attacking your game, Ralf. I'm not.<br>> There were just a couple of items in your analysis which were<br>> troublesome for me. For example, in addition to not being a<br>> simultaneous move game, 55Stones is also not a perfect information<br>> game. In a perfect information game, all of the information is<br>> available at a glance, without requiring amazing feats of memory, of<br>> which few of us are capable. If a pit contains twelve stones for<br>> example, it's not immediately obvious how many stones there actually<br>> are. Granted, you could scoop the stones out of each pit and count<br>> them all but I believe this practice is generally discouraged if not<br>> outright prohibited in many cases.<br>> I have one final observation which I don't have time to investigate so<br>> I'll propose it as a question. You claim that draws aren't possible,<br>> but I'm wondering if two cooperating players can keep the game going<br>> indefinitely.<br>><br>> F.S.<br>> > You are interpreting the term "move" as the component of your turn<br>> > in which pieces are actually moved<br>> No, I didn't. Pieces could also be "placed" as in Go.<br>> BTW, I think most languages don't have different words for "turn" and<br>> "move" (in French always "coup"; in German "Zug").<br>> > players' moves (i.e. execution of their turns) should be entirely<br>> > simultaneous, which they're not.<br>> It appears that you didn't understand the rules. The moves are<br>> simultaneous and even equally fast (if it is assumed that the picking<br>> up of stones happens in zero time and only the distribution consumes 1<br>> time unit per stone).<br>> > 55Stones is also not a perfect information game. In a perfect<br>> > information game, all of the information is available at a glance,<br>> > without requiring amazing feats of memory, of which few of us are<br>> > capable<br>> Perfect information is a term from combinatorial game theory, not<br>> something you may define by yourself. Even mancala games with<br>> never-ending moves such as Bao or Omweso are still perfect information<br>> games. The CGT definition has nothing to do with human capabilities.<br>> Please, just read some basic CGT literature before you start<br>> discussing "perfect information"!!!<br>> See: http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/PerfectInformation.html<br>> > You claim that draws aren't possible, but I'm wondering if two<br>> > cooperating players can keep the game going indefinitely.<br>> You could even ask if there are never-ending moves, but I never found<br>> such a position although I tried hard to construct one. I agree,<br>> however, that the mathematical prove is still missing.<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> > The CGT definition has nothing to do with human capabilities.<br>> Mark, in fact, you are confusing cognitive psychology with<br>> mathematics. "Perfect information" is strictly mathematically defined.<br>> What Cohen actually meant was that "games with simultaneous<br>> decision-making are a strict subset of ..." -- which is correct.<br>><br>> A.D.:<br>> I agree that 55Stones is indeed a game of perfect information. I'm not<br>> convinced though that it is a game of simultaneous decision making.<br>> Sente makes his choice first with no way of knowing what Gote will do.<br>> Gote then makes his choice with full information now of how the board<br>> will play out. Only the move resolution is simultaneous. In this<br>> aspect I must concur with Mark that 55Stones does not contradict<br>> Cohen. (BTW, could you post in which book/article Cohen made the<br>> statement?) Sure love the game though! Smile<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> When Sente chooses a pit, a decision Gote is aware of before he<br>> chooses his own pit, Sente isn't just "deciding" his move. He's openly<br>> selecting it. Sente has initiated his move (ie action taken during his<br>> turn) ahead of Gote. That's a long way from simultaneous.<br>> For examples of true simultaneous games here on SDG see Pulling<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> Hello,<br>> the decision-making is indeed not simultaneous, which is the very<br>> reason that 55Stones is a game of perfect information (if "move" in<br>> CGT isn't defined as a physical mechanism e.g. putting stones on the<br>> board or "moving" pieces from one node to other nodes). So Cohen's<br>> statement was at least misleading as he used the word "play" without<br>> explaining to the reader of a general game magazine who is not<br>> necessarily a mathematician what he actually meant mathematically.<br>> Ethnologists don't care for decision-making at all. If they see a game<br>> in which moves are performed at the same time, they call it<br>> simultaneous, they don't care whether the decisions for these move<br>> were really made exactly at the same time or not. The same is probably<br>> quite true for most gamers who are not interested in maths. 55Stones<br>> is also a game of complete information according to CGT. It doesn't<br>> matter, btw, which decisions are made in the future. You never now<br>> what your opponent will play in the future, except he has just one<br>> move left (e.g. simple compulsory capturing in Draughts). If we<br>> analyze 55Stones, there are 10x11=110 positions after the first pair<br>> of simultaneous moves. The first player (sente) has 11 moves which he<br>> can chose, the second (gote) has then 10 to decide upon. So, if I<br>> chose a particular move as the sente player, the eventual outcome is<br>> already narrowed to 10 positions (out of 110), and the other player<br>> narrows it to a single position (out of these 10).<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> > Ethnologists don't care for decision-making at all.

As I said, the Sente player's<br>> selection of a pit is more than just a decision. It's an action. It's<br>> an open, incontrovertible, and irrevocable claim. It is the initiation<br>> of the Sente player's move.

As I pointed out the traditional games<br>> are ambigous, because it is not determined who is starting first. You<br>> are supposed to start your move right after the other player, so that<br>> both moves are performed at about the same time, however, you can<br>> "react" to your opponent's decision much like you do in a blitz game.<br>> I simply removed this ambiguity. So, in fact it should be called<br>> "simultaneous" if we just follow the general conventions accepted in<br>> mancala games. And, as I said every move has (at least) two<br>> components: decision and execution. I don't consider one above the other.<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> Ralf, as you pointed out to me, the term "perfect information" has a<br>> long established meaning which is not up to me to redefine. By the<br>> same token I now point out to you that the term "simultaneous game"<br>> has a long established meaning which is not up to you to redefine.<br>> This is not a group of ethnologists discussing the history of Mancala<br>> games. This is a group of gamers who have their own very clear concept<br>> of what a simultaneous game is.<br>> The flaw in your logic is simply this: What you refer to as "decision<br>> and execution" is actually just execution and more execution. By<br>> claiming a pit and informing your opponent of said claim you have<br>> initiated the execution of your turn. And you have initiated said<br>> execution ahead of your opponent's doing so, batting 55Stones clear<br>> out of the simultaneous game ballpark.<br>> You can describe your game any way you like. That's your prerogative.<br>> But to refer to 55Stones as a simultaneous game in any general gaming<br>> forum, such as this one, is only going to invite ridicule.<br>> That's all I have to say on the matter. I now leave the badly deflated<br>> ball in your court where hopefully it will stay.<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> > By the same token I now point out to you that the term "simultaneous<br>> > game" has a long established meaning which is not up to you to<br>> > redefine.<br>> Dont you see that you redefine these terms? The term "simultaneous"<br>> has been used for a long time by ethnologists to describe games with<br>> certain moves that are simultaneously perfomed on the board, but have<br>> no rules that would guarantee a simultaneous decision-making or even a<br>> start at exactly the same time. Your argumentation is weird ("This is<br>> not a group of ethnologists ...") and pure rhetorics. I am not going<br>> to waste my time with this nonsense!<br>> > The flaw in your logic is simply this: What you refer to as<br>> > "decision and execution" is actually just execution and more<br>> > execution.<br>> It is a huge difference between a mental process and a physical<br>> process. As I have pointed out the long established meaning of<br>> "simultaneous" in games (long before even CGT existed) is the<br>> simultaneous execution of a physical process (what I called the<br>> execution of a move [on the board]).<br>> > But to refer to 55Stones as a simultaneous game in any general<br>> > gaming forum, such as this one, is only going to invite ridicule.<br>> These awkwards comments (if you have no arguments, you start personal<br>> attacks) are so typical for you, can't you see that this is a<br>> boastfull and insulting behavior?<br>><br>> A. D.:<br>> Please let's keep things civil.<br>> Not being an ethnologist I cannot speak for traditional Mancala games.<br>> Perhaps in a traditional setting we would all agree that<br>> "simultaneous" is an apt adjective but that's not where we are. The<br>> comments we are making are related specifically to your wording of the<br>> rules for 55Stones. By "removing the ambiguity" we are suggesting that<br>> the game can no longer be considered "simultaneous" because Gote must<br>> wait until Sente claims a pit and then decides and executes based on<br>> that knowledge. In games such as Pulling Strings both players actually<br>> execute their move at the same time and there are special rules for<br>> situations where the same choice is made. For 55Stones to be truly<br>> simultaneous the same would have to be true. We are not attacking your<br>> integrity nor the game itself. We are simply saying that we disagree<br>> with your choice of words in the official rules and therefore certain<br>> assertions made therein.<br>> Again, I would really like to avoid a flame-war. Smile<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> In fact, it is just a matter of definition, but I don't see why a<br>> "long established meaning" that originates in ethnological writings<br>> should be less "apt" than any other definition. We are not - as a<br>> community - mathematicians either (I am not). So, 55Stones certainly<br>> could be called a simultaneous game if we choose to define any game in<br>> which several players move at the same time as being "simultaneous".<br>> It would be rather narrow-minded not to accept diverging definitions<br>> and to attack these opinions as "ridiculous". And, I am certainly not<br>> lowering my academic level just because I happen to be "in a general<br>> gaming forum" now!<br>><br>> M.S.:<br>> > The flaw in your logic is simply this: What you refer to as<br>> > "decision and execution" is actually just execution and more<br>> > execution.<br>> > It is a huge difference between a mental process and a physical<br>> > process.<br>> Ralf, my previous comments were intended to be my final comments,<br>> because I thought I had made my argument as clear as humanly possible.<br>> But I can see from your response that you're still utterly fogbound.<br>> My intent is not to attack you or insult you, but try to understand my<br>> frustration here. You are apparently unable to comprehend the rules to<br>> a game which you yourself designed!<br>> Here I quote from the rules which YOU wrote:<br>> "East starts. Each move, one player takes the contents of one hole in<br>> his hand, then the opponent must take the contents of another hole in<br>> his hand. The player who has the privilege to decide first has sente<br>> (a Go term), the other player has gote."<br>> ONE player starts by taking the contents of one hole in his hand, a<br>> PHYSICAL ACTION! Then the opponent takes the contents of another hole<br>> in his hand, ANOTHER PHYSICAL ACTION! The player who has sente<br>> performs his physical action FIRST! You have clearly described a<br>> PHYSICAL, TURN BASED PROCESS!<br>> Now you're claiming that this whole sente/gote, turn based grabbing of<br>> stones is really just a pair of mental decisions? Unbelievable!<br>><br>> F.S.:<br>> Misunderstandings<br>> Obviously you deliberately try to misinterpret and contort the rules.<br>> Whether you take the contents of a hole in your hand, point with a<br>> finger on a hole or just name the hole is completely irrelevant. The<br>> first step consists of making a mental decision which contents are to<br>> be physically moved in the second step (as usual in mancala games by<br>> "spreading" stones one by one into consecutive holes) AND to make this<br>> decision somehow visible. If you could communicate with your opponent<br>> by telepathy, reading his mind, that would be completely sufficient.<br>><br>> A.D.:<br>> Are you then suggesting that Sente and Gote could just as reasonably<br>> choose a hole to empty at exactly the same instant? If that is so then<br>> the entire tenor of the game changes. The distinction of Sente and<br>> Gote vanishes and the game truly becomes simultaneous in the sense<br>> that most members of the SDG community accept. You are correct that<br>> one can define a word to have any meaning you choose. The core of this<br>> disagreement comes from the fact that you choose to define the word<br>> differently from Mark, me, and others. That's fine. In which case we<br>> should all just agree to disagree and move on.<br>> Nobody is "deliberately trying to misinterpret or contort the rules."<br>> We are simply stating that because Sente makes a move without<br>> knowledge of Gote's intentions whereas Gote acts in full knowledge of<br>> Sente's choice that the term "simultaneous" (as defined by us) does<br>> not apply. You are welcome to feel differently. These assertions are<br>> in no way meant to impugn your intelligence or right to feel<br>> differently.
