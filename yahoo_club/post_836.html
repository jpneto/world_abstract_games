    <div>Hi Ralf,<br><br>>I don't understand some rules of Abstract Puluc. Could You help me?<br>>(1) Can you jump over other stacks when you capture?<br><br>Well spotted! I didn't state that. As I recall, captures cannot jump.<br><br>>(2) You write that in a normal move(when you neither capture nor <br>stack <br>>friendly pieces) you must move exactly as far as the biggest enemy <br>>stack is high. So what are you doing if the last row is closer than <br>the <br>>exact moving range?<br><br>The piece cannot reach the last row, unless it moves backwards to <br>capture. Then it may have another chance.<br><br>>Is, in your example, the black stack at a6 blocked? If not, to <br>which <br>>square must it move, if it moves forward?<br><br>After the White move (which it would build a stack of size 9) no <br>black moves are possible. Anyway, Black must capture c5:e5.<br><br>I updated the rules. Once again, thanks for your comments.<br><br>Cheers, Jo=E3o</div>
