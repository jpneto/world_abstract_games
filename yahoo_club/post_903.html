    <div>John Pierce (texascarver.com) makes a great, though expensive, <br>custom 10x10 board.  I too absolutely could not find anything but an <br>8x8 for sale anywhere.  In addition to my prized 10x10, I also <br>happened to find an antique 12x12 board which had been made into a <br>side table.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, markthomps <no_reply@y...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>> <br>> > BTW "Standard Checkers equipment" differs according to the place <br>you <br>> > are: France (10x10) board, Tamils in Sri Lanka (12x12) board, <br>irregular <br>> > boards in Mauretania and Kavkaz (the latter occupied by Russia <br>since <br>> > the mid 18th century). <br>> <br>> Yes, I've heard that.
