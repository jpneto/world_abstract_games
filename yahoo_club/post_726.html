    <div>Announcing the latest version of Random Xong [tm]:  Revision 1.36<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/xonghome.html<br>http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/rxong.html<br><br><br>Introduction:<br><br>Xong[tm] is an abstract game for 2 players. It is a Territory game.  I<br>invented Xong back in 1996. While searching for a name, I was trying<br>to find out what the australian aborigine word for those dried-up<br>lakes that make a tesselated caked mud surface and a friend was<br>suggesting "billabong", which was a dried-up oxbow kind of thing and,<br>POW! just like that, the sport clothing line came out! :-D - so i have<br>named my game "Xong". Xong is also a vietnamese word for the end of an<br>exam when i googled it, along with various proper names on other <br>hits. ==> Pronounce that "zong".<br><br>Where Go has been compared to an entire campaign of war and Chess,<br>perhaps, to one of it's battles, Xong might then be analogous to a<br>single swordfight down on the battlefield. Typically Go games take<br>hundreds of moves to determine a victor while chess may take 80 or so<br>moves. Xong takes around 30 moves. I am not sure what this may have to<br>do with the game's complexity. I find the complexity quite enough to<br>have kept me up long hours of the night working out variations.<br><br><br>Description:<br><br>Xong is played with pieces, called Xoids, made out of the sides of<br>hexagons, connected together in a rigid 2-dimensional form that are<br>placed over vacant sides of a 2-d field of hexagons connected along<br>their edges. Each Xoid can only be used once. In order to be a new<br>Xoid, it cannot be rotated and/or flipped over into the shape of a<br>Xoid already played. As long as the Xoid can be placed over the board<br>  on vacant legs, any Xoid shape is legal. The object is to wall off<br>more hexagons than your opponent with legs of your own color. You<br>neednt fill all 6 sides, but rather just make it impossible for your<br>opponent to touch any of those 6 sides. If both sides touch a hexagon<br>it doesnt count for either player and is said to be "greened out".<br>Xong is a position game, but there is no capturing.  Xong never gets<br>into a repetitive impasse or deadlock. However, Xong also has a defect<br>in it's Ruleset: at the end of play, when one player is unable to give<br>a new Xoid to the other, instead, as a means of compensation, he gives<br>1 point. This prevents ties, but is philosophically an artificial<br>construct outside of the geometry of the board & piece patterns. This<br>is called the Xong point.<br><br>You may have noticed i referred to *giving* new pieces. This is<br>central to the operation of the game. It is like baseball in that you<br>give a piece to the other player to play. Then after it is played,you<br>are given back a new piece to play. It's like hitting a pitch.<br>Naturally, you want to give your opponent the piece that does the<br>least damage to you. The Xoids given begin with the smallest ones and<br>gradually increase in size & complexity until there is no more room on<br>the board for any new piece. Each piece can only appear once in a<br>game. Since secured hexagons are worth 2 points, at the end of the<br>game one player will have an even score and the other will have an odd<br>score including the Xong point. Thus there cannot be a tie game. And<br>the gradual increase in size, with jumps located at the 2nd player's<br>turn, have made this game similar to progressive Chess and also<br>extremely neutral to the first or second player.<br><br>There are currently 2 active versions of Xong - a Standard game of 61<br>hexagons arranged in an order-5 hexagonal grid, and a Random variant<br>that generates random boards of about 57-68 hexagons arranged in one<br>blobby weird shape that is never the same way twice. The random<br>version might seem to violate the letter of law regarding abstract<br>games by introducing an element of chance, but once the board is<br>created, both players are in possession of 100% of the game<br>information. Nothing is hidden. The Random variation was created to<br>head off any stockpiling of memorized openings, such as has happened<br>in Go and Chess. Even Standard Xong already had developed an Audrey<br>Gambit Declined opening. The Standard game is still using an obsolete,<br>slightly buggy java applet, so i wouldnt recommend trying that at this<br>point.<br><br><br>Some Elements of Strategy:<br><br>At the beginning you give your opponent the smallest Xoids you can.<br>There are 19 that touch 5 or less hexagons. The 1st piece is just one<br>leg, which touches 2. You avoid double touching hexes you have already<br>touched and you avoid touching the wall around the board which doesnt<br>count for anybody. The "cold value" of a move can be calculated by<br>adding up how many new hexagons it touches for you, how many of yours<br>it cashes (walls off) and how many of your opponent's hexagons it<br>touches (greening out that hex for nobody).<br><br>At some point, you may want to construct a long serpentine Xoid that<br>can only fit around the outside edge where a lot of greened-out hexes<br>are. I've called these "Wall-Crawlers". They can suddenly crop up in<br>the batting order around turns 15-25. It is best to keep a good eye<br>out for the conditions where they come into play. A number of times<br>you may give one of the 19 to your opponent and it will be placed in a<br>way that creates a wall-crawler situation.<br><br>I've also termed this general concept of the shrinking of possible<br>playable places "Habitat Extinction". Often you can construct a piece<br>that can only go in one place. Once you have identified the salient<br>leg shape that accomplishes this, you can then add on other legs that<br>block off access to your hexagons or ruin your opponent's niches by<br>ballooning the niche into a place that can take many other Xoids than<br>the one planned. I call that process "Festooning".<br><br>Sometimes a sizeable area gets left behind as the players cannot bear<br>to give the other a piece that fits in there for the score it will<br>make. They instead find wall-crawlers or similar awkward shapes that<br>cannot go in there. When this happens, i call it a "Ko fight".<br>Eventually someone will get to play in this vacant area, winning the<br>Ko.<br><br>Another development that can occur in the late going will be walling<br>off a spot that only one new Xoid can fit in. If your opponent gives<br>you this piece you can play it in some other region of the board<br>(tenuki) and then that seals the space as is! So you can "remotely"<br>cash some hexes in this manner. Hence you will probably not be given<br>this piece for awhile. You can give it to your opponent if the remote<br>cashing is favorable to you, because then to play it elsewhere works<br>against the cold value for tenuki and to your advantage, while playing<br>it in the spot may also be a low cold value. There are other cases<br>where a spot may have a different value depending on who plays in it.<br>During the course of the game, you'll want to create as many of these<br>asymmetrical spots as you can, as long as you're keeping up with all<br>of the other things going on.<br><br>As the game winds down to the end, there is often an opportunity to<br>control who will have the last move. Remembering that the player to<br>gets the last move must then give the other the Xong Point, certain<br>cool things can happen, if you are paying attention.<br><br><br>The Website as of now:<br><br>I have a website with some java applets (j2sdk1.4.0_01 applets) for<br>single workstation play. There are new-window browser links to the 7<br>rules, an example Standard game replayed with a java applet, a table<br>of *some* of the pieces, the buggy Standard game playing java applet<br>and the newest state-of-the-art Random game playing java applet. These<br>playing applets automatically keep a running score & shade in hexagons<br>for each side, greening out hexes touched by both colors & cashing<br>hexes that are roped off as they occur during play. The old Standard<br>applet is buggy still and no longer supported for the current interim.<br>  The random version represents the best representation i have to<br>offer at the moment and has fixed the bug that led to a rare occurance<br>of faulty cashing during play.<br><br>I still do not have a way to play against an opponent live over the<br>net like the go & chess & stlts servers do. I am working on this and<br>hope to unveil the world's first Internet Xong Server someday soon. In<br>the meantime, i can explain how to play over the net via email and the<br>java appletviewer. Just ask me at greystone@....<br><br>In order to play this on your web browser, you'll need to be able to<br>run java applets, either via Java Web Start or by plugins within your<br>browser. Some browsers can get the applet running, but for some<br>strange reason, despite all claims to the contrary in the java toolkit<br>descriptions, the text comes out too small to read. Perhaps screen<br>resolutions finer than 1024x768 lead to this. Perhaps some font files<br>may be damaged. Xong applets use Helvetica which is a pretty standard<br>default font. I developed it on my Linux side and can view it fine<br>there as well as in my Mozilla browser on my Windows XP side. A<br>brother of mine can view it on a Mac. If you are firewalled off from<br>the outside world with applets, then perhaps i can work out the email<br>solution.<br><br><br>Invitation:<br><br>You are welcome to check out Random Xong at:<br><br><br>    http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/xonghome.html<br><br><br>Scroll down to the bottom and click the Random Xong link. This should<br>open a new browser window so you can do other things and keep this<br>active on the sidelines.<br><br>But you should also view the Example Game just to get a quick<br>heads-up. The commentary in it is ancient. But there are still some<br>useful points.<br><br>I would like to know if you have any problems AND if you dont seem to<br>have any problems. Feedback _either_ way is *good*.<br><br><br><br>Thank you,<br><br>- nate, inventor of Xong[tm]</div>
