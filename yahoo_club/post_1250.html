He<br>initiates a few debates here and there but then it quickly starts to<br>escalate.  If you disagree with him on any trivial point, no matter<br>how politely, he publicly announces that he's been "insulted".  How<br>dare anyone question the world's leading authority on (fill in the<br>blank)?

He will<br>spam-obliterate the group with crazed claims of persecution by the<br>group members *and* owner (who may not even be aware of what's been<br>going up until now).  You can already see signs of that here with Herr<br>Herman providing links to this group owner's place of work and calling<br>for his colleagues to chastise him.  There's no doubt whatsoever that<br>Herr Herman has already contacted said group owner, and his<br>colleagues, and Yahoo management who are collectively wondering "Who<br>is this weirdo!?".  It gets worse though - a lot worse.  Soon there<br>will be a frenzied fax/letter/email campaign directed at Yahoo,<br>threatening law suits and calling for this group owner's ouster.<br><br>Herr Hermann has the exact same M.O. everywhere he goes.  He did this<br>at the Yahoo stacking-games group and eventually got kicked out.  He<br>did this at SuperDuperGames and eventually got kicked out.  He got<br>kicked out of the German Wikipedia after throwing a tantrum there over<br>the "Internet book" (their expression) that he was trying to publish<br>in their encyclopedia.<br><br>After being kicked out he unfailingly launches an internet-wide smear<br>campaign against the person who kicked him out.  Herr Hermann has been<br>dormant for at least a year now so he's overdue for a psychotic<br>eruption.  Just don't IAGO be next on his hit list.  In its fledgling<br>state, IAGO could quite possibly be destroyed by Herr Hermann.<br><br>Now, be advised:  Herr Hermann has a number of aliases so he might not<br>be easy to spot right away.  But if you're reading an email or forum<br>post and you begin to sense the distant sound of boot heels clicking<br>together, that's a sign.  <br><br>All of this isn't designed to "get a shot in" at Herr Hermann.  This<br>is for real.  Watch out for Herr Hermann.</div>
