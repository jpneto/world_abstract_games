    <div>Just as I said I never used this term. And don't be confused by the<br>manipulations (=3D omissions) in Steere's nonsense posts, just read the<br>complete thread below.<br><br>> > http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/message/1381<br>> <br>> I never used the term "simultaneous move game" as Mark Steere claimed.<br>> It's a typical method he uses: he invents a statement which allegedly<br>> was made by someone, then he says that this person is wrong. Just read<br>> the whole thread given above.<br>></div>
