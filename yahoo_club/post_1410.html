    <div>I would like to run this concept as part of the Chess of Tomorrow<br>project. Someone in discussing the future of chess, brought up<br>Calvinball. The posted a link to one set of rules:<br>http://www.bartel.org/calvinball/<br><br>There is one permanent rule they have for Calvinball on that page.<br>That rule is this one: You may not play the Calvinball the same way twice.<br><br>So the basic framework for the ultimate chess variant would be, can<br>you have a chess playing framework that would enable a person to NEVER<br>play chess the same way twice (by the exact same set of rules). A<br>softer version of this challenge would be that a person would play<br>both side (black and white) each once, before moving on to a set of<br>rules. A Calvinball tournament would consist of this rules though.<br><br>Please feel free to discuss this hear, or if you want it to add to the<br>Chess of Tomorrow project, post in here:     <br>http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/forum/t-51667/chess-of-tomorrow-project-who-is-interested#post-139883</div>
