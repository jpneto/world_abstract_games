    <div>Book of the Month: <br><br>100 Strategic Games - For Pen and Paper<br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br><br><br>This book was written in April 2002 by Walter Joris, a Belgium expert <br>on paper-and-pencil games. It covers 100 games invented by Joris (as <br>claimed by him), except a few traditional games which were adapted to <br>be played on paper. You won't find Dots & Boxes, nor its French <br>forerunner La Pipopipette (invented by famous mathematician Edouard <br>Lucas in 1889). Also, Alternator is not included, one of my <br>favourites invented by Gregory K. van Patten in the 1990s. Moreover, <br>many traditional games are missing, which can easily played on paper, <br>such as Tic-tac-toe or Renju. This isn't really a drawback because <br>you'll find many games, which might be totally new for you.<br><br>Mancala lovers will be surprised to find several Mancala variants:<br><br>1.<br>Joris' Awele (#86)<br><br>This is the same game as traditional Oware (Awele, Warri, etc.), just <br>a simplified version played on a 2 x 3 "board". In the paper-and-<br>pencil version counters are crossed out before they are taken out of <br>their basin and distributed. Mancala enthusiasts might be annoyed by <br>his final statement: "A disadvantage of the Mancala games is that <br>they can become rather drawn out."<br><br>2.<br>Tornado (#87)<br><br>Obviously a plagiarism as this game is almost identical to Cirk <br>(Corn=E9 van Moorsel, 1998). It only differs in a slightly different <br>starting position.<br><br>3.<br>Canicas (#88)<br><br>A very interesting game which can easily be made far more challenging <br>by increasing the number of internal rows (within the "fields" =3D <br>holes) from 3 to 6 and using 11 holes, instead of just 6. I also <br>would permit two marbles to be dropped on the larger board in each <br>player's  first move, not just one. The game has a territorial <br>aspect, rather unusual for Mancala games.<br><br>4.<br>Rumba (#98)<br><br>Identical to La Tchouka (English: Tchuka Ruma), which was probably <br>invented by famous mathematician Henri Delannoy (discoverer of the <br>Delannoy numbers) in 1895 by transforming a Malay game to fit into a <br>mathematical problem. The sub-variant given by Joris is known as Le <br>Tchoukaillon, invented by V=E9ronique Gautheron in 1977.<br><br>Joris' book is very cheap (US$9.95 and Euro even less) which could be <br>an additional reason to buy it.<br><br>Ralf</div>
