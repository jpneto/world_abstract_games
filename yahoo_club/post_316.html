    <div>> Joao Neto writes:<br>> <br>> "After each move, any stack not in contact with <br>> a DVONN piece is captured by the player that <br>> made the move.  A stack is in contact if it has <br>> a DVONN stone, or is adjacent to another stack <br>> in contact."<br>> <br>> The second sentence is wrong. A stack is in <br>> contact if it has a Dvonn piece, or if it is <br>> connected with a Dvonn piece (or a stack which <br>> contains a Dvonn piece) through an unbroken <br>> chain of pieces. <br><br>It sounds to me as though you and Joao are saying the same thing, <br>only he's giving a recursive definition.</div>
