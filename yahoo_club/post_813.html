    <div>> What about Trax ?<br><br>I'm a poor Trax player although I win most games. I don't understand <br>why I win so many games so perhaps Trax isn't very clear to me. <br>However, I must have a good intuition about what constitutes a good <br>move. Perhaps clarity is as much psychological as mathematical. Only <br>one board position changes per move, the winning condition is very <br>simple, but the notation very complicated. Perhaps the latter points to <br>some "anti-clarity" (hey, native speakers: what's the opposite of <br>clarity?). <br><br>Really, intuition is another nice concept in playing a game well. It's <br>very important in Go, Blokus (I am FiveStars at blokus.com)and probably <br>in any game which is not very "tactical"!<br><br>Ralf</div>
