    <div>Do we have the rules codified somewhere, or was it just discussed in<br>the thread on Fischer's Random Chess?<br><br>A reason why I ask about Fischer's Random Chess (Chess960) is that it<br>is played in forms on tournament level, and it would be useful for<br>promotion purposes to have IAGO oversee it.  Idea would be to end up<br>modifying it so it fits the IAGO standard definition better, and then<br>called "IAGO Standard Chess960".  <br><br>Personally, I was looking at an alternative to Fischer's Random Chess<br>(for IAGO) anyhow, which I am calling "IAGO Standard Billion Chess"<br>(tell me there is a name for it already).  Players alternative placing<br>their pieces in the back row.  Castling can still happen if there is<br>at least one rook to the outside of the king (with similar conditions<br>as in regular castling of the rook and king not moving, and king not<br>in check or not castling through check).  Castling consists of the<br>King moving next to the rook on the inside, and then the rook is<br>placed to the inside of the King.  Chess plays out normally, but<br>layout of pieces are in complete control of players. There is no luck<br>in here, but there is a chance of preferable lines of play developing<br>(this is what Chess960 sought to counter). <br><br>So, is Thompson's Non-Random Chess codified anywhere up on the web?</div>
