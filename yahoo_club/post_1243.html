    <div>No problem, Rich.  I'm kind of hung up on the "purist" interpretation<br>of abstract games so I think it would be best if I just bowed out and<br>let you handle IAGO as you see fit.  I just didn't want to see IAGO<br>turn into a McAbstracts, but that's probably not likely to happen, and<br>even if it did, it wouldn't have a huge impact on my life.<br><br>I guess the main thing is to remain civil, as you said.  Whatever you<br>do, don't go the way of the gestapo.  There's a reason the vile Herr<br>Hermann was the only member ever to be kicked out of SuperDuperGames.<br> I don't want to dredge up all the gory details here.  After all it<br>happened a long time ago.  But at the same time, Herr Hermann's<br>totalitarian legacy should be remembered lest history repeat itself. <br>He's no longer a threat really.  Since being banned he's descended<br>into the shadowy underworld of the sockpuppet, pitting his own aliases<br>against one another in games of his own design that nobody else wants<br>to play - to create the illusion of public interest.  It's kind of sad<br>when you think about it.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I will look to calm down. I am in no mood to get into heated arguments<br>> with anyone.  As far as I am concerned, IAGO needs to make as many<br>> friends as it can here.  There is a lot at stake.  I ask everyone (and<br>> demand of myself also) civility and patience.  Please realize that<br>> IAGO isn't going to be perfectly what everyone wants.  I would like to<br>> see a lot of groaning acceptance though, out of necessity of what<br>> needs to be done.<br>> <br>> What I will say is I look to have 2 player combinatorial game theory<br>> games at the core and the "gravity point" things are supposed to head<br>> towards.  These games are more likely to get accepted into the<br>> International Mind Sports games for one thing.<br>> <br>> As I see it, practical reality does call for acceptance of Chess960,<br>> Dark Chess and even Backgammon.  Even the case of where IAGO may end<br>> up getting involved in a chess-poker hybrid tournament (or even a<br>> poker-backgammon tournament).  IAGO isn't looking to be a poker<br>> association, but if getting IAGO on TV explaining what it stands for<br>> and represents and so on, needs to be done, it needs to be done.<br>> <br>> I am asking people to please be civil (including myself) and also<br>> realize that more harm will come to IAGO if things are done wrong,<br>> that ever can happen to abstract strategy games (or abstracts). <br>> Definition creep is a big deal to me.<br>> <br>> And Mark, I am not looking to kick your games out of IAGO.  I do want<br>> them in, but realize that you may object to the way IAGO is going and<br>> not want them there.  IAGO needs to respect the wishes of designers<br>> out there.  I personally believe it is counterproductive to you, but<br>> the decision is yours.<br>> <br>> Also, please add your two cents (in a civil manner of course) and see<br>> if you can get involved.  The IAGO World Tour can definitely use 2<br>> player only combinatorial game theory games dominating it, so see if<br>> you can get any.  This will set examples in place to prevent deviance.<br>></div>
