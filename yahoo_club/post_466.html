    <div>(I wrote the following in response to a thread "What is the best?",<br>in a mailing list of the AGPC -- Association of Game and Puzzle <br>Collectors.  The thought has been with me since 2001, after I read<br>J. Mark Thompson's "Defining the Abstract", and Bob Abbot's "Under <br>the Strategy Tree" as well as his musings regarding Ultima...)<br><br>... Bob Abbot the inventor of Epaminondas/Crossings, used the <br>terms "clarity" and "depth" to describe the best games.  My "computer <br>science" paraphrase would be the following: Having clarity means a <br>winning combination (or solution to a puzzle), once found, is easily <br>demonstrated/verified.  Having depth means it's hard to find that <br>combination (or solution), and in fact there are multiple levels of <br>strategy and skill.<br> <br>A jigsaw puzzle, solved, is confirmed at a glance.  A one-color <br>jigsaw puzzle, cannot be confirmed at a glance because some pieces <br>may sort-of fit -- i.e. lacking clarity.  A well-made jigsaw puzzle <br>also has depth -- the shapes and graphics make possible different <br>methods of sorting and fitting the pieces.  (My nine-year-old <br>daughter loves them.)<br> <br>In computer science, there's the theory of NP-complete problems: a <br>combinatorial puzzle so hard, that any of a huge family of known <br>combinatorial puzzles can be "reduced" to the given one.  A problem <br>is Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP) if it is easily (polynomially) <br>solved, provided one _always_ guessed right (!!), at every step. <br>Depth is the characterization that these are _not polynomial_ but <br>rather require an exponential amount of search. Clarity is the <br>characterization that a solution, once found, is easily <br>(polynomially) verified.  It was proven mathematically that NP = <br>Clarity.  However, demonstrating that NP = Depth (i.e. NP not= P) is <br>one of the outstanding open problems of mathematics!<br> <br>-- William Chang (Saratoga CA)</div>
