    <div>Boorman, Scott A. The Protracted Game: a Wei-ch'i Interpretation of Maoist <br>Revolutionary Strategy. Oxford University Press 1969.<br><br>Contents<br><br>The Asian game of wei-ch'i- known to the Japanese and to the West as go - <br>has been a favorite with Chinese generals, statesmen, and literati for more <br>than 2,000 years. Unlike chess, which is oriented toward the concentration <br>of forces at a point upon the board, in wei-ch'i a player attempts to extend <br>his control of territory; avoiding direct confrontations, he encircles his <br>opponent. The similarity to guerilla warfare is obvious.<br><br>Mr. Boorman provides a detailed description, with diagrams, of the game. He <br>the suggests parallels between wei-ch'i and Mao Tse-tung's strategy against <br>Chian Kai-shek and the Nationalist armies during the Chinese Civil War, <br>giving weight to political as well as military factors.<br><br><br>"If the analogy is valid, then the Communist takeover of China was played on <br>a huge imaginary wei-ch'i board and lasted 22 years. And its lingering <br>implications would have a significant bearing on Southeast Asia today."<br>- New York Times -<br><br>"I've seen a number of efforts to shed light on strategy by the analysis of <br>a game, and this is the first one that really works."<br>- T. C. Schelling, Center for International Affairs, Harvard University.<br><br>>How stupid can you be?<br><br>As stupid as Scott Boorman, a renowned graduate of Harvard College can be.<br><br>>Do you have any evidence to support your<br>>interpretation of this game?<br><br>see above<br><br><br>>Do you think that *any* game with a<br>>military theme represents U.S. imperial ambitions?<br><br>It's not so much on U.S. ambitions in particular, but on guerilla warfare in <br>general. But that is, what the U.S. occupation forces now face in Iraque.<br>Not every strategy game is simulating guerilla warfare. The best games doing <br>that are probably Go/Weiqi and Guerilla (which was invented in the 1970s <br>which wasn't a coincidence either). Games are very often related to the  <br>social, cultural, historical and religious situation of the time in which <br>they were created. Si it might be quite important to know the nationality of <br>the inventor. For instance, the swastika in the center of the "Rautenm�hle" <br>board  is not a harmless Hindhu symbol or Germanic romanticism but it did <br>professes Nazi ideology which was obviously supported by the (unknown) <br>inventor of the game.<br>I appears  that mathematicians or natural scientists are often blind in <br>regard to this dimension of games, but undoubtly games are far more complex. <br>Actually the magazine "Board Game Studies" is mostly about the cultural <br>meanings of games.<br><br>>But at least you<br>>are now admitting Iraq has missiles.  ;-)<br><br>Hey, I never said, they hadn't. BTW they were permitted to have missles.<br><br>Dan, you have invented some good games (Alta, Breakthrough and Sabin Rains), <br>but why did you enlarge Breakthrough from 7x7 (as first published in <br>Zillions) to 8x8? Just to participate in the contest of AG magazine? True <br>you have won the contest, but many readers then complained about your game <br>in letters to the editor published in the next issue of AG because the game <br>turned out to be rather lengthy. The larger board does not add much depth to <br>the game, but makes the opening quite boring. In my opinon, it's a childish <br>behaviour to worsen a good game for participating in a contest! Before you <br>did that, Breakthrough was just perfect! My suggestion: enlarge your Alta <br>board a little bit, but go back to your former board size in Breakthrough.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Most Americans of this forum just prove what the majority of Europeans think <br>of you:<br>which is that most Americans are political analphabets and are as deceived <br>as most Germans were 60 years ago. But as the saying goes: "Who don't want <br>to listen, must (learn by) feel(ing)." You will harvest what you sow.<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>Wu�ten Sie, da� Sie Ihren Hotmail-Posteingang auch �ber den MSN Messenger <br>abrufen k�nnen? http://messenger.msn.de Jetzt kostenlos downloaden und <br>einfach testen!</div>
