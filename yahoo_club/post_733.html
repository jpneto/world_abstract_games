    <div>Steve & Ralf, could one of you email me the rules of Alternator, or<br>ask Greg for permission to post it?

It's a very unusual <br>expression of<br>> the territorial theme (and perhaps also of the connection theme), <br>and it's<br>> fun to play on as small of a board-size as 6x6.<br>> <br>> I got the rules for Alternator from Greg himself.  I found the <br>ruleset to be<br>> counter-intuitive at first, but once I'd actually played it several <br>times I<br>> was delighted in the game.
