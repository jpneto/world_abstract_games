    <div>I agree that draughts might not be the best example<br>for clarity, and hex might work better as a good<br>example for decisiveness than bad for drama.  <br><br>Speaking of drama, all positions in abstract games<br>(meaning lacking in both hidden information and<br>randomizers) are definitively 'winning', 'losing' or<br>'drawn'.  The only sense in which finer-grained ideas<br>of a 'weaker' or 'stronger' position are meaningful is<br>through failure of the players to completely perceive<br>the structure of the game, either through strong depth<br>or weak clarity.  So I suppose that a game with good<br>'drama' is one where there is an easily-perceived<br>indicator that correlates strongly (but not reliably)<br>with won positions.  Chess is definitely a good<br>example for this...'material advantage' can be defined<br>and perceived much more easily than whether a position<br>is won.  Your mileage may vary on what qualities of a<br>position are easily perceived, though...I'm unaware of<br>any similarly obvious indicators for Hex, but I'm a<br>newbie, so maybe I just don't know what they are.<br><br>-Andy<br><br><br>--- Ralf <Peace_Panther@...> wrote:<br><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, joao_neto_1970<br>> <no_reply@y...> <br>> wrote:<br>> ><br>> > Mark Thompson's article 'Defining the Abstract'<br>> refers four <br>> > qualitative features of abstract games: depth,<br>> clarity, drama and <br>> > Depth:<br>> >  Good - Go<br>> >  Bad - Tic Tac Toe<br>> <br>> Somebody said:<br>> "Playing Draughts is like looking into a well, while<br>> playing Chess<br>> is like watching over an ocean." -- Probably Go is<br>> like studying the <br>> universe.
