    <div>Iqishiqi is an interesting game.  Potentially short, and definitely <br>difficult to extrapolate positions.  A nice use of neutral pieces, <br>with that solitary stone acting as both the goal and referee.  <br><br>The rules are not really that difficult to comprehend.  There seems <br>to be a good number of tactics, such as placing stones to block your <br>opponent's path.  <br><br>There are no draw conditions.<br><br>Question: Did any hex game show in the competition?</div>
