    <div>> Thanks, I don't remember having seen that game. It's similar in some<br>> ways, but I think the playing experience would be quite different.<br><br>Yes, I suppose so. Only the idea is similar, the games are different.<br><br>Anyway, you should have a rule to deal with stalemate positions where<br>there is no valid empty cell at knight's distance.<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
