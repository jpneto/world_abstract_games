    <div>Mark, as someone working to get a sports federation/trade organization<br>fully functional (and not dependent upon one person), I have no<br>interest to get dragged into any personal feuds people have.  There is<br>too much at stake to get bogged down in pettiness.<br><br>Since Ralf references this forum for discussion, I felt it was best to<br>also get on the record I don't approve of it.  It is best for the<br>handful of people out there to actually see I don't approve of Ralf<br>and for them to know that he booted me out of one of his forums, and<br>also threatened to sue me.<br><br>I will say that you DO irritate people Mark.  This can result to the<br>wrong mix at times, and you getting a perpetual enemy.  Now you have a<br>chronicler of every comment you make that can be seen to offend.  Oh<br>well, it goes with the territory I guess.</div>
