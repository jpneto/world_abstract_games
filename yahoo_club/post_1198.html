    <div>> Once it is worked out, It will have the IAGO Standard version<br>> Chess960.  The object is to find out the best way to have black and<br>> white place pieces down to get an official Chess960 layout, with<br>> randomization.  There is issues of how many pieces each side should<br>> place down, and is there an order, like rooks first, then bishops or<br>how?<br>> <br>> Please comment on the best way to do this...<br><br>Just as a suggestion, I would have White place any White piece he<br>likes onto any square in rank 1, and the corresponding Black piece<br>onto the corresponding square of rank 8, subject only to the condition<br>that at least one legal FRC opening setup can be completed from the<br>position. Then Black does the same thing, and so on until they've<br>completed the array. Then they play the game.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
