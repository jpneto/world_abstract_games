    <div>I recall reading somewhere (how's that for citing<br>my sources?) that Scientific American actually ran<br>this contest in the 1980s. A million dollars was at<br>stake with the actual payout to be divided by the<br>number of entries. The number of entries you could<br>submit was limited only to the biggest number you could<br>fit on an index card. Naturally people wrote in with<br>entries like "googleplex to the googleplex" which reduced<br>the pot to zero. Nobody won because the judges could<br>not figure out which number was the biggest.</div>
