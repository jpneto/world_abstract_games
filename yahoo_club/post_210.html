    <div>Hello all,<br><br>I was out of the club for a couple of weeks, and just saw the <br>discussion today.<br><br>In fact, this group was initially started to welcome discussions <br>about perfect-information games, i.e., no luck, no hidden <br>information. The "theme" is a minor concern herein; it does not <br>matter if the pieces are called Kings, stones, moons or whatever. <br><br>There are thousands of games, and accordingly, there are hundreds of <br>groups and mailing lists that deal with each game subtype. Of course, <br>this is not written on stone. People may think that a good argument <br>can be brought based on a Backgammon position or concept, for e.g., <br>and I have no problem with that. But this is more an exception that <br>the rule. Focusing on a specific game group prevents Internet <br>flooding of contents. That's why there is rec.games.abstract on the <br>1st place...<br><br>I was never thinking of CGT definitions when I propose this club. CGT <br>games are included on perfect-information games, not the opposite. So <br>CGT games are welcome, but they do not exhaust the discussion context.<br><br>There is also no strict restriction of 3+ player games, even if I <br>didn't have them in mind by the time I decided to create the club. <br>But as always, only if they fit into the perfect-information category.<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
