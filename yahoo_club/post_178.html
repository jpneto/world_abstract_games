    <div>> We're not saying non-abstract games aren't strategic, or<br>> that they don't exercise the mind -- only that they do<br>> so in a fundamentally different way. In what I call an<br>> abstract game, the player has ALL the information needed<br>> to determine the best move, if only he had the intelligence<br>> and the time to use it.  Not the "probably best move,"<br>> the VERY BEST move.<br><br>Hi Mark,<br><br>I've always thought that backgammon, yes, even though it uses dice, is a<br>borderline case on being considered a true abstract strategy game.  Please<br>note that many backgammon positions do indeed satisfy your above<br>requirement.  As an example, take a look at the 1st and 4th problems on this<br>page:<br><br>   http://www.inficad.com/~ecollins/backprobs.htm<br><br>In both cases, there is only one best move and the player has ALL the<br>information needed to figure it out.  In both positions #1 and #4, there is<br>no "probably best move," but a VERY BEST move.  (In both positions, Red must<br>make the one play which best saves the gammon.)<br><br>Of course, most backgammon positions aren't so cut and dried.  It's often<br>difficult to determine which move is best, especially when one has the<br>random dice element to consider.  But when using two dice, since the odds of<br>rolling any combination of numbers are known, then one can simply take this<br>into account when determining what the VERY BEST MOVE will be.  Sure, the<br>dice gods may not be favorable, but it was still the best move at the time,<br>and should be again played if the exact same position where to occur again.<br><br><br>Ed Collins</div>
