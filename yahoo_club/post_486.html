    <div>> In Germany Reversi was always popular. It's a little bit weird a <br>copyright <br>> matters as long as the inventor is alive.<br><br>Are you saying the inventor of Reversi was still alive when Othello <br>was published? That's news to me. I thought Reversi was invented in <br>the 1880's, or thereabouts, and Othello not until the late 1960's.<br><br>As I understand copyright law, copyrights extend to the death of an <br>author plus a fixed period afterward. The fixed period varies from <br>country to country, but the EU has been standardizing it by <br>increasing it to the longest time. I think that was 70 years. Then it <br>got hairier because France had a stipulation that "years of war" were <br>not counted in the copyright time, and when the EU adopted this <br>additional provision, certain works that had previously been public <br>domain turned proprietary again, much to the consternation of <br>publishers who had begun treating them as public domain.<br><br>So I could see how the literary heirs of the original author(s) of <br>Reversi might have owned a valid copyright on the original text of <br>the rules, but are you saying the original authors were STILL ALIVE <br>when Othello came out?</div>
