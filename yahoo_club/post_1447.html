    <div>These are the rules to Dipole Chess:<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=3DMSdipolechess<br><br>Take regular chess, and prevent people from making non-capture moves<br>laterally or backwards (Castling is permitted also though).  Otherwise<br>it is the same.  Not only can you lose if your king is captured<br>(rather than checkmated), if you can't make a legal move, you also lose.<br><br>My experience with the game is that it is easy to mess up in a big<br>way, with both sides reasonably close.  But the game can never end in<br>a draw, and will always run a finite number of turns.  Despite this,<br>and it being more restrictive as far as moves, the game feels pretty deep.<br><br>I wanted to see if anyone else here had thoughts on this, if they were<br>to argue how much more shallow it is compared to normal chess.</div>
