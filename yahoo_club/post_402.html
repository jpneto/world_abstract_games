One <br>player or the other would have to be the first to get six points, if <br>either one does.<br><br>One way one could play it would be to give each player 21 stacking <br>checkers. Each turn, a player removes one checker from each stack of <br>checkers he has on the board, and then places a stack of 6 checkers <br>on any vacant square. Not that that's profound or anything.</div>
