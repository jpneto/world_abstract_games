    <div>Hey Mark, I want to add something about Dipole.  When I had first read<br>the rules, a few things didn't click with me.  I didn't play, just<br>read the rules, and read certain things into it.  I ended up reading<br>into the rules how other games work.  In my case, I just didn't get it<br>until I just read the rules, and stop reading things in, and then it<br>clicked.<br><br>What you could be seeing is people PRESUMING things are there, and<br>they play the game that way, like no backwards moving.  Also, they<br>presume the game is in the stacking game family and works like Focus,<br>where the objective is to capture the pieces of the other player. <br>Dipole is an outlast your opponent game, with capture as a means of<br>doing this.  It is a bit unique in this regard, and people end up<br>missing something.<br><br>In other words, it is "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing". <br>People may be doing this with Dipole and missing the game itself. <br>Like, they wonder why you can't move backwards, and so on. I found<br>that the best thing is to PRESUME people are idiots (In other words,<br>they will not have the same blatantly obvious assumptions you have),<br>but don't ACT with them they are.  If you do the reverse, PRESUME they<br>are moderately intelligent and then ACT like they are idiots when you<br>relate with them, you end up disappointed at life, AND also have very<br>poor relationships with humanity.</div>
