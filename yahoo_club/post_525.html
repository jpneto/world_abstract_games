    <div>>   I have read that blue and white pieces were fairly <br>> common in Roman games.<br><br>My guess would be that the reasons for color choices have <br>historically had more to do with pigment technology available at the <br>time than with symbolism attached to colors by different cultures. In <br>fact, the symbolism attached to colors often derived from the <br>convenience of coloring something: as for example, the expense of <br>purple dye made purple significant of nobility; in Renaissance <br>Europe, black cloth was the most expensive and was worn by royalty, <br>etc. <br><br>Perhaps something similar applied to the colors used for game pieces. <br>However, remember that I'm factically analphabetic, so it could have <br>been something else entirely.</div>
