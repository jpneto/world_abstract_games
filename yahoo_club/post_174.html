    <div>What if a game allowed for its pieces, which are tiles of various <br>values, to be turned over and shuffled before being placed upon the <br>field upside down?  This is a form of random generation utilized by a <br>particular Chinese game.  Neither side knows the location of their <br>pieces until a piece is turned over as a move.<br><br>Would you consider Backgammon merely a game of chance?  There are <br>strategies within its play.<br><br>Random generators are not "incomplete information", just not-yet-<br>determined.  The information is there, for example a standard die <br>absolutely represents the array of 1 through 6.  One must merely take <br>into account all probabilities when preforming moves.<br><br>There can be strategic purpose to the use of a random generator.  The <br>use of a single standard die creates a simple 1 in 6 probability, <br>multiple dice create nice bell curves of probability.</div>
