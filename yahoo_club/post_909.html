    <div>><br>>Dave Dyer (of BoardSpace.net fame) mentioned something about <br>>starting a site for games played with a Checkers set. <br><br>That was more of idle speculation than an actual plan.  If boardspace.net<br>ever becomes sufficiently busy that it needs to split, that could be<br>one possible division.  In any case, I'd be more interested in original<br>games (LOA, Byte, Focus) than in infinite variations on standard<br>checkers rules.</div>
