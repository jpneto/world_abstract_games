    <div>It's true that some games, once solved, become unplayable, because<br>a simple winning strategy is known.  It is extremely unlikely<br>that this applies to chess.<br><br>If chess becomes "solved" it will not be any easier or harder to play, <br>and the programs that play it will not get any better or worse.</div>
