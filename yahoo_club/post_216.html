    <div>> >> GOAL - Wins the first player that moves at least one of his <br>stones <br>> >> to the enemy base, while that base is totally occupied.<br>> <br>> This nonsense was first promoted by Wayne Schmittberger in his <br>> book "New Rules for Classic Games" (which contains many more <br>> mistakes).<br><br>First, as for this rule being a "mistake": Schmittberger gives the <br>object for Halma (page 88) as follows: "The object is to get all of <br>your pieces to the opponent's starting area, which is diagonally <br>opposite your own starting position. The first player to achieve this <br>wins." He then adds on page 89: "While the original rules did not <br>make this explicit, a player should not be allowed to block his <br>opponent's victory by leaving one or more pieces in his home area <br>indefinitely. Thus, it is necessary to add a rule that a player wins <br>any time, other than at the very start of the game, when the starting <br>area diagonally across from his own starting area is full of pieces, <br>regardless of who owns those pieces."<br><br>So you should clarify that Schmittberger is making a mistake in <br>misrepresenting the original rules here; he is only explicitly <br>suggesting a rule fix (though I agree the word "necessary" is a <br>mistake, in light of other and better fixes). If it turns out that a <br>dishonest player (i.e. one not really trying to win) can still <br>subvert the game, then I'd still say this fix was a reasonable first <br>attempt, one that probably inspired later improvements, and <br>not "nonsense."<br><br>Second, are you sure Schmittberger was the first to propose this? I'm <br>almost sure I read this first in something by Sid Sackson, though I <br>can't find the reference right now. Especially, I remember seeing the <br>condition that the goal area had to contain at least one of your own <br>stones, which is an idea I don't find in "New Rules for Classic <br>Games," so I must have seen it somewhere else.<br><br>> "If one player has left his base, the other player must also leave <br>> his base (or move towards the exit of his base). Other moves are <br>not <br>> permitted."<br>> <br>> The beauty of this solution is that the original winning condition <br>of <br>> Halma remains unchanged.<br><br>The winning condition is unchanged, but the rules governing play have <br>changed significantly. Since the situation we're trying to fix does <br>not arise when both players are playing "in good faith" (i.e. trying <br>to win), I think we should reject a rule fix that forces an honest <br>player to play differently.<br><br>I'd prefer one of the other fixes that declares a player the victor <br>when he's done all he can against a dishonest opponent, thereby <br>removing any incentive to dishonesty.</div>
