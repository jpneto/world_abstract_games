    <div>Thats a great answer Joe!<br>   <br>  Sorry to hear about you not knowing about the Chess variants! I hope you were not to disapointed! Have you seen the ones on zillions of game (i think?). I do like chess but prefer backgammon.<br>   <br>  Anyway, yes, i agree, sometimes we've just got to design for designs sake! & its fun! By the way, i just stumbled accross super duper games dot org - 'different' games to play online other than the usual suspects.<br>   <br>  Colin<br><br>Joe Joyce <mjjoyce3@...> wrote:<br>          --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "shinermons"<br><shinermonsgames@...> wrote:<br>"Why do we design?"<br><br>Don't know how good this answer is, but I design because I have to. <br>I enjoy games; started playing chess when I was 10 and wargames at 12.<br>Within a few years, I was "fixing" some of the things I didn't like in<br>my games. After I got out of school, I played wargames almost<br>exclusively because I lacked opponents and most AH/SPI-style wargames<br>were able to be played solitaire.

A couple of them were decent,<br>and I thought about trying to sell them, but didn't see how I could<br>compete with established companies. One game I worked on, off and on<br>for decades, was a 4D chess variant, without any knowledge that CVs<br>existed. After I retired, my son got me online, and I started looking<br>around for games. I found the ChessVariants site, and got hooked on<br>designing variants - it's cheap entertainment! ;-) <br>I design games I enjoy playing. Most are now chessvariants, at least<br>technically, but some aren't, and a few I think have commercial<br>potential. So I'm working on selling them, but not all that hard. If I<br>see a way to have what I think is a reasonable chance at success, I<br>will invest a bit and make a serious effort to sell some of my<br>designs. But the basic truth is that I design because I enjoy it, and<br>the ideas, when I have them, force themselves out of my brain, down my<br>arm, and onto a piece of paper. <br>Joe<br><br><br><br>                         <br><br><br>Shinermons Games<br>  P.O.
