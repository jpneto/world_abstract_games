    <div>A couple of questions:<br><br>1) Is the term "fame" used as meaning most popular or most played? Or would <br>it be more along the lines of games judged somehow as "most worthy", perhaps <br>by meeting some list of criteria or passing a trial by committee? Or, even, <br>games not necessarily deemed "best", best known, or most played, but maybe <br>some considered to first, seminal, or paradigm setting?<br><br>2) Would any categories be established initially?<br><br>(I have to admit, I have a personal bias towards chess variants and the <br>historical board games.)<br><br>Thx! Kiitos! Cheers!!<br>-Matt in Seattle  :)<br><br>----- Original Message ----- <br>From: Rich Hutnik<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 2:24 PM<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] What abstract strategy games should be part of a <br>Abstract Games Hall of Fame?<br><br>I am looking for suggestions here from people. One IAGO project is to<br>get a Hall of Fame formed for abstract strategy games. Please suggest<br>which ones you feel should be part of the list.<br><br>Looking at an initial list of 10, but may be larger.</div>
