    <div>Luckily, Byte is adaptable to a variety of Checkers sets.  On an 8x8 <br>board with 24 checkers, you form three stacks of eight.  On a 10x10 <br>board with 40 checkers, you form five stacks of eight.  On a 10x10 <br>board with 30 checkers, you form three stacks of ten.  And on a 12x12 <br>board with 60 checkers, you form five stacks of twelve.  Basically, if <br>the number of checkers is evenly divisible by an odd number, you're <br>good to go.<br><br>Never heard of Kavkaz Dama.
