    <div>Dear Friends: in Argentina, I=B4m founded in 1997, an NGO (the<br>Alternative Games & Sports Commission -CODASPORTS-), which is the<br>government body in the majority Abstract Games (and a lot of sports<br>too). Except Othello, Chess and Go, a list of 65 abstract games are<br>represented by CODASPORTS in Argentina. Is wonderful idea and you have<br>all support from me and CODASPORTS Argentina.<br><br>Kind Regards<br><br>Ricardo Acuna - www.codasports.com.ar <http://www.codasports.com.ar><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> Abstract games have been given the short end of the stick in the table<br>> game arena. I believe this should be dealt with. As a result, I am<br>> looking to get an association started to promote abstract strategy<br>> games. There is a petition you can "sign" on the Web to express your<br>> support, and a forum to discuss the idea.<br>><br>> The forum is here on the Super Duper Games Site:<br>> http://forums.superdupergames.org/viewforum.php?f=3D14<br>><br>> If you are interested in having one started, please sign the<br>> petition:<br>> http://www.petitiononline.com/asggroup/petition.html<br>><br>> The name IAGO (International Abstract Games Organization) was proposed<br>> as a possible name by Bill Taylor on rec.games.abstract, and I happen<br>> to think that is a cool name myself.<br>><br>> Anyhow, if you want to get involved, pleas sign the petition and visit<br>> the forum.<br>><br>> Thank you for your time...<br>> - Richard<br>><br><br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
