    <div>Dave Dyer (of BoardSpace.net fame) mentioned something about <br>starting a site for games played with a Checkers set.  If I could <br>make a suggestion for that potential site, Dave, make it so that you <br>can play in real time *and* you can take a break for a day or two, <br>or some adjustable time limit agreed upon by the two players, and <br>continue the gameplay after the break(s).<br><br>Mark<br><br>Never heard of Archimedes.  BoardGameGeek doesn't say too much about <br>it.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, markthomps <no_reply@y...> <br>wrote:<br>><br><br>...<br><br> <br>> I've often thought it would be good to have a booklet (or a book?) <br>of<br>> interesting variants that can  be played with checkers equipment. <br>> <br>> There are lots of "straight" checkers variants, by which I mean <br>games<br>> whose rules could all be expressed by writing putting various <br>options<br>> into the checkers rules and then saying something like, "German<br>> Checkers uses options A1, B3, C2, and D4; Spanish Checkers uses<br>> options A2, B4, C1, and D3; etc." <br>> <br>> (Someone could even make a website: "Name your own checkers <br>variant!<br>> Choose your combination of options, type in the name you want, and<br>> send us $20. You will receive a rule book and certificate, and your<br>> variant will get its own page on this website!! Act now, supplies<br>> going fast!)<br>> <br>> But besides all those, there are original games like Byte and <br>Impasse,<br>> Archimedes and Loa, playable with standard checkers equipment, that<br>> more people could be enjoying.<br>> <br>> Mark Thompson<br>></div>
