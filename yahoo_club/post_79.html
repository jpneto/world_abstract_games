    <div>I believe that what you refer to is sometimes<br>called a "move stealing strategy". Which is a fancy way<br>of saying that a game has been<br>"solved".<br><br>There are several examples of this sort of thing. For<br>instance, the game of Nim is solved. Hex on an NxM board<br>with N and M unequal is solved, and so is a game<br>called "Bridg-it" (also known as "Gale" or<br>"Connexxions").<br><br>When a game gets "solved" in this way, some people try<br>to remedy it by artificially blocking the symmetries<br>which permit the "move stealing" strategy. However, I<br>think this tends to be artificial, and it seems likely<br>that most move stealing strategies could be easily<br>modified to accomodate such artificial<br>fixes.<br><br>Having said this, the game of Go has a "sort of" move<br>stealing strategy, although it does not really work. You<br>can just move symmetrically opposite of your opponent<br>every time you move. Unless your opponent captures the<br>center of the board, you cannot lose in this way. Even<br>though it is possible to counter this strategy, it is<br>annoying, and makes for a dull game. Some ideas for<br>eliminating this problem are<br>at<br><br><a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~vanpag/weiqideas.html target=new>http://www.rpi.edu/~vanpag/weiqideas.html</a><br><br>Greg</div>
