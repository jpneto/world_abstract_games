    <div>Hex can now be played at http://www.boardspace.net/<br><br>I was surprised to find that Hex is a really interesting game,<br>not just one with nice theoretical properties. Most Hex games<br>play very fast, because after 10 moves or so it's obvious that<br>one player or the other has won. Curiously, it seems to always be<br>the more experienced player, no matter which color he plays.</div>
