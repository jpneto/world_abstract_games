    <div>> > So you should clarify <br>> <br>> Why should I? I never claimed that Schmittberger misrepresented the <br>> original rules. <br><br>Because someone who read your earlier post could well have thought <br>that was what you were saying, and being a civilized, polite person, <br>you would naturally want to be careful that what you say would not <br>inadvertently do an injustice to another man's reputation.<br><br><br>> > I'd still say this fix was a reasonable first <br>> > attempt, one that probably inspired later improvements, and <br>> > not "nonsense."<br>> <br>> It's nonsense, because it wasn't well thought out. It proves that <br>> Schmittberger had no true understanding of the problems caused by <br>the <br>> original rules. <br><br>Schmittberger, and perhaps Sackson, probably intended to prevent a <br>poor player, who had made an honest attempt to win the game, but had <br>neglected to advance one piece from his home area, from realizing <br>that he could take advantage of that circumstance, and weakly <br>yielding to the temptation to show a pathetic cleverness by thwarting <br>the other player's victory. They never thought of how a player could <br>BEGIN a game of Halma with malice aforethought, never intending to <br>enjoy the game himself or allow his opponent to enjoy it, already <br>planning sabotage when he took his seat, smirking to himself in his <br>private, gleeful anticipation of sin. That was a depth of iniquity, <br>of baseness, of awful bestial malignity, to which their essentially <br>lofty and noble imaginations could not stoop.<br><br>> As I stated before, this problem was fixed in Germany <br>> at least half a century ago, so it's not a first attempt as you <br>> claim. <br><br>I yield. It was undoubtedly the Germans, in the 1940s, who figured <br>out how to break this game, and consequently found it necessary to <br>take the utmost pains to fix it. The best locks are to be found in a <br>den of thieves.<br><br>> American authors like Schmittberger and other smatterers only <br>> produce a painful impression. Furthermore, he did not inspire later <br>> improvements but caused much confusion among American would-be <br>Halma <br>> players.<br><br>Ah, so it's the Americanness of Schmittberger and myself and perhaps <br>Sackson that is responsible for our inability to grasp how the game <br>must be plugged against these sordid machinations. Thank you for <br>clearing that up. Certainly it's true that we Americans have a <br>wholesome outlook on life, which makes us like to have fun when we <br>play games. No wonder everyone loves us.</div>
