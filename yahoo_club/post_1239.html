    <div>Gentlemen:<br><br>  There has been a bit of over-reacting going on here. I'm glad to see<br>both of you seem to realize this. I was contemplating a somewhat<br>stronger post than this, and had started it, but then saw the previous<br>2 messages [1237 & 1238]. <br><br>  I sincerely request that any disagreements, in print at least, be<br>conducted in a more respectful and impersonal manner; name-calling and<br>mud-slinging does not fit well with the image of an abstract games<br>group, and does nothing to improve your own images. Rather, it<br>detracts from what you both wish to do, which seems to be to get a<br>larger audience for abstract games in general. That you choose to<br>go about it in considerably different ways should not make you enemies.<br><br>  I hope you gentlemen now realize that it is folly to fight; you both<br>may gain through co-operation. Mark, you have the technically more<br>nearly correct definition [if there actually is or can be one], but<br>you have put abstract games up on so high and fine a pinnacle that<br>very few can fit there. Richard, you have the serious problem of<br>debasing the currency, so to speak, but the plain fact is that your<br>approach is the one that has a chance of success.<br><br>  Gentlemen, compromise is the art of life. Surely the two of you can<br>find common ground, if you wish to. You both have the same goal, after<br>all, one which I share. [How else am I, designer of a very nice series<br>of shatranj variants, ever to get more than a handful of people to<br>play these games?] Please realize, both of you, that each of you is<br>right - yes, life really is that messy. There is no valid reason for<br>you to be at odds, and certainly no reason for you to descend to<br>hitting each other. A lot of energy is being wasted over what is<br>primarily a semantic squabble. Mark, you could be an intellectual<br>leader of IAGO, but not by constantly poking Richard. And Richard, you<br>should put that energy you're using to hit Mark back to much better<br>use by building the organization. There is room in both the world and<br>in IAGO for "real, genuine" abstract games, and for games which are<br>not wholly abstract, but have many of the characteristics of abstract<br>games. What is the harm in saying: "this game is abstract, but that<br>game is only semi-abstract"? People will understand, if the<br>information is properly presented.<br><br>  Finally, might I ask you to consider this for at least 24 hours<br>before you reply? I assure you I am not trying to make this a<br>three-cornered fight. I do wish you to see you do not have to<br>completely agree with each other to work toward the common goal. If<br>you can, the possibilities of reaching that goal are enhanced.<br><br>Joe</div>
