    <div>Hi Joao,<br><br>Your project looks very interesting!  I have a few questions:  Is Ludae's purpose to improve the skill of computer players, human players, or both kinds?  What is the format of the tournaments, e-mail or online? (E-mail is slower but results in higher quality moves, which would affect how much is really learned).  The ELO ratings look to play a crucial role in differentiating "good" knowledge from "bad" knowledge --- but how are the ratings established in the first place?  I'm curious about the assigning of discrete values to concepts such as drama and clarity --- is it really so easy?  And can a computer be taught to recognize patterns in the same way a human does? <br><br>Steve<br><br> <br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: joao_neto_1970 <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Monday, October 07, 2002 8:31 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] PROJECT LUDAE<br><br><br>  Hi,<br><br>  I created a new site to present my future<br>  research project, and talk about it with<br>  all interested people.<br><br>  From the website introduction: <br><br>  "This project focus on how a system based on a hybrid attitude  <br>  between total competition and total cooperation, might be able to <br>  extract knowledge in order to improve its own performance over a <br>  specific working problem: Learn how to play a given game well."<br><br>  Check it at: http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/ludae/index.htm<br><br>  Cheers,<br><br>  Joao Neto<br><br><br>        Yahoo!
