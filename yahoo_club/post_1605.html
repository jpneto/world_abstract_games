    <div>I can also vouch for Lessons in Play.  It is clearly written, and I was able to grasp the bulk of it despite having a minimal mathematical background.  Moreover the authors are reachable --- I contacted them once regarding a game-theoretical idea of mine (which turned out not to have much merit).<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: mark_steere <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Thursday, February 04, 2010 5:30 PM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: Dots and Boxes / Flume theory<br><br><br>    <br><br><br>  --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, burkemat <no_reply@...> wrote:<br>  > <br>  > WW is a brilliant book and very entertaining, but it can be quite a slog. Wolfe has another book which he co-authored with Michael Albert and Richard Nowakowski which is specifically a textbook on CGT.
