    <div>The September issue of GAMES (their 25th anniversary issue) describes <br>a new game called Dominions, by Christian Freeling (author of the <br>games at the mindsports.net\Arena site. Apparently it's going to be <br>added to the site soon, and it looks like the site will be revamped. <br>In the illustration, the background is white instead of that (to me) <br>unpleasant blue.<br><br>Dominion is played on an order-9 hexagonal grid (hence of 217 cells, <br>if I figured that right), and has elements of Go, Othello, and <br>Kaliko. The pieces are hexagonal tiles, somehow made so that they can <br>only be placed on the board in one orientation (on a computer screen <br>that's easy, of course), white on one side and black on the other, <br>and each player has a set of 63 tiles in hand. Each tile is marked <br>uniquely with from one to six lines connecting the center to the <br>midpoints of the various sides. (Since these tiles cannot be rotated, <br>and they all have at least one line, 2^6-1=63 are possible.)<br><br>Then the game resembles Go, where a group of allied pieces are <br>connected by these paths, and has to retain at least one "liberty" <br>(path terminating on an open space); but if it loses its last <br>liberty, it gets flipped to the other color (as in Othello) rather <br>than removed.<br><br>There are some other rules regarding placement (see GAMES, you should <br>be subscribing anyway! or mindsports.net will have definitive rules <br>soon). Schmittberger gives it his highest recommendation. I look <br>forward to playing it.</div>
