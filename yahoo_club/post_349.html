    <div>Hello Claude Chaunier,<br><br>fantastic! You can Czech! I can now translate the rules of one game <br>in about an hour with an dictionnary. Not bad for someone who never <br>learnt a Slavic language?<br><br>Can you tell me what Sachovany means? Something with Chess, but what <br>exactly? (Chessling?)<br>The game (follow link below) is said to originate in the USA. Does <br>anybody know this supposedly American game?<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/sachova2.htm<br><br><br>There are still 18 games I need to translate.<br><br>The best games which I discovered so far and which are not described <br>elsewhere on the web are:<br><br>Doppelte Dame<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/dama.htm#Dvojita<br>(rules as in Anglo-Saxon Checkers , but two chess boars side by side, <br>White starts - I had to learn Czech to find the rules of a German <br>game!!!)<br><br>Jeu de Dames Africaines<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/a-dama.htm<br>(always capture the largest number, because the game is obviously <br>influenced by Jeu de Dames International)<br><br>Kavkaz Dama<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/o-dama.htm<br>(the Checkers variant of the Chechen freedom fighters was obviously <br>influenced by T=FCrk Damasi; play it with 33 pieces each player on a <br>board having 7x11 intersections)<br><br>Stredovetka bitva ("Medieval Battlefield")<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/s-bitva.htm<br>(a fascinating checkers variant, reminiscent of Parton's variants -- <br>necessary additional rule: the "rytiri" may not move back to a square <br>where they came from in the last move)<br><br>Ball's Chess<br>http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/b-sachy.htm<br>(just wonderful this game, not really a chess variant as there are no <br>royal pieces; goal is to reach one of the two squares where initially <br>the generals of the opponent were located)<br><br>BTW Boardline is actually Boarderline and not correctly described <br>(see the British Boarderline homepage).<br><br>truthforum<br><br> <br><br><br>> > http://www.sweb.cz/lada.chytrackova/hry/seznam.htm<br>> <br>> Wow, cool. I can Czech a little. And the author of these nice pages <br>> can English and German and she likes people writing to her :)<br>> <br>> I told her about Joao's present site and address, as she wrote a <br>> page about Gonnect with old references and asked for the new ones.<br>> <br>> Cheers<br>> Claude</div>
