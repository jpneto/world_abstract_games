    <div>Some questions concerning the rules:<br><br>(1) Can you jump over other stacks when you capture?<br><br>(2) You write that in a normal move(when you neither capture nor stack <br>friendly pieces) you must move exactly as far as the biggest enemy <br>stack is high.  So what are you doing if the last row is closer than <br>the exact moving range? Is, in your example, the black stack at a6 <br>blocked? If not, to which square must it move, if it moves forward?<br><br>Ralf</div>
