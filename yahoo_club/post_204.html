    <div>Nice idea. I think, the game is a draw. All the games I played ended <br>in a draw. One player simply places his stones so that the other <br>can't make a "pente", while at the same time he avoids a group of <br>stones which can be captured. Just don't try to make a pente <br>yourself, and you should be able to achieve a draw.<br><br>TruthForum<br><br> <br>> Anyone have comments, or want to try a game by email (or maybe <br>using <br>> Zillions)?</div>
