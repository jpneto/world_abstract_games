    <div>> Games of the Abstract are played on fields of various sizes and <br>> shapes, with objects of various shapes and colors, between any <br>number <br>> of opponents, governed by rules from simplistic to complex.  An <br>> abstract game can consist of only pencil and paper.  Random <br>> generators are acceptable.<br><br><br>If you go back to this clubs message #2, the Welcome message in which <br>Joao described the Group he was founding here, he says:<br><br>>I decided to create this club as a<br>>kind of extension to "rec.games.abstract".<<br><br>If you look at http://www.newsville.com/news/groups/rec.games.html<br>, you will find that rec.games.abstract is dedicated to "Perfect <br>information, pure strategy games." Hence, no random generators.</div>
