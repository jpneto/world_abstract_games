    <div>> I had one game position where I would win the game,<br>> no matter what colour was chosen by the opponent to <br>> occupy the critical cell. A true zugzwang!<br><br>Interesting! Paul van Wamelen and Cameron Browne found a position (a <br>variant line in one of their games) where neither player could play <br>either color in either of two different cells, yet each player <br>appeared (as it stood) to need one of those two cells in order to <br>win. If the line were played out, developments elsewhere on the board <br>might have changed the balance, so evaluating the game was NOT as <br>simple (Paul explained to me) as counting the remaining non-forbidden <br>moves and awarding victory to the player of the right parity.</div>
