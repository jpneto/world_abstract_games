    <div>Wow, I didn't realize it was until I managed to get this tidbit in my<br>email box:<br><br>[stacking_games] Rich Hutnik and his IAGO<br><br>Rich Hutnik's membership has been suspended for supporting criminal<br>activities against me. Beware of IAGO which has such an immature<br>founder / leader. Ralf<br><br><br>The apparent criterion for acceptance in this group is hating Mark<br>Steere.  If you decide you don't want to, you are "supporting criminal<br>activities" against Ralf.<br><br>I will let the IAGO forum fully know this.  Sheesh, how much does one<br>have to be an annoyance to end up causing a heated argument between<br>two people to stop suddenly?<br><br>By the way, anyone know if Ralf has any abstract strategy games he<br>designed he might want to not be in IAGO.  I can make sure they are<br>removed.</div>
