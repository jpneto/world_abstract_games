    <div>I've uploaded to the Files section the Zillions-of-Games <br>implementation of ZERTZ which I've been working on for several <br>months.  I hope that the Group will test it for me.<br> <br>Because Zillions is primarily a chess engine, it oftens doesn't play <br>alignment or accumulation game without far look-aheads on the turns.  <br>I believe that I've worked the coding for this game so that this is <br>no longer necessary.  Try running the game at Strength=Expert, <br>Variety=Large and Averge Time=1-3min.<br> <br>This is still a test version, so I expect some constructive criticism.</div>
