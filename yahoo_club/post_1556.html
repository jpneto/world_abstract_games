That would mean that the last four moves would occupy the four corners, and whoever makes the very last move would lose. If n is divisible by three, the last move would belong to the third player; otherwise, it would belong to the first player. <br><br>But this would mean (wouldn't it?) that two players would each get  one corner, and the other player would get two. The player getting two corners would win, according to the smallest-unique-number of corners rule. And all players will know who that player would be from the start, based on the size of the board.<br><br>So if I were playing on an 8x8 board, I'd know that the first player will win if we do nothing but avoid connecting edges; so if I were player two or player three, I would feel a need to connect some edges. And then, if I were player one and saw players two and three striving to connect edges, I'd have to worry that simply avoiding connecting edges and awaiting the last four moves wouldn't be good enough. So I'm inclined to think that the strategy wouldn't be as simple as not making connections.<br><br>But there is the difficulty inherent in 3-player games, where a player will sometimes be in the position of no longer being able to win himself, but will be able to choose which of the other two is to be the winner. This is sometimes called the "petty politics" problem.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
