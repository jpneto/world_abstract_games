    <div>Is it allowed to make multiple centering and/or adjoining moves, or a centering or adjoining move in conjunction with a jump move or sequence?  I get the impression that it is not, but I'd like to be sure before I play the game further.<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: mark_steere <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Wednesday, September 22, 2010 10:19 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: searching for answers/opinions about why questions<br><br><br>    <br>  --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Steven Meyers" <swmeyers@...> wrote:<br>  ><br>  > <br>  > <br>  > What do you think about Cage? <br>  > <br>  > http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br>  > <br>  > I've tried out Cage several times but I'm not sure <br>  > I've understood the rules correctly.

Sorry about the confusion.

That is, you aren't required to initiate your turn with a jump, unless that's the only type of move you have available. Once you've made a jump though, you can't make any other type of move during your turn. And you may be required to make additional jumps while it's still your turn."<br><br>  I will take a shot at clarifying this pat too though. Thanks for the feedback. Btw Cage is programmed at SuperDuperGames, so if you want to give it a quick run-through I'd be more than happy.<br><br>  -Mark<br><br><br><br>  <br><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>  No virus found in this incoming message.<br>  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com <br>  Version: 9.0.851 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/3152 - Release Date: 09/22/10 02:34:00<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
