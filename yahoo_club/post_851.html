    <div>Happy birthday Herman!  How old are you now - four?<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> Hello,<br>> <br>> I have just reported to Yahoo! the following abuse:<br>> <br>> Hello,<br>> <br>> Mark Steere is defamating me by spreading lies in the group <br>stacking-<br>> games. I left this group because he and the owner of the group was <br>> defending stereotypes and racist attitudes. <br>> <br>> Steere now posted:<br>> (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking-games/message/180) <br>> <br>> "I'd like to take a poll on how many people are relieved that Ralf <br>is<br>> gone. He had written a flattering article about me in Yahoo<br>> abstractgames. Said article has now actually been removed, so I <br>assume<br>> that Ralf is moderator there as well."<br>> <br>> Top Ten Reasons You Might Be a Nazi:<br>> <br>> 1. If you have an irresistable urge to snap your heels <br>together . . .<br>> you might be a Nazi."<br>> <br>> <br>> The group to which he refers (abstractgames) is owned by Joao <br>Neto. <br>> Actually I wrote: "I admire Mark Steere (because of his wonderful <br>> games.)" This was before I met him on stacking-games. When I got <br>to <br>> know his true character, I removed my message from abstract <br>games.  <br>> But there is still a response to my message which proves that I <br>say <br>> the truth: <br>> http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/abstractgames/message/825<br>> <br>> This is criminal conduct. If you don't remove Mark Steere from <br>Yahoo!<br>> Groups I will report his behavior to the police and also that <br>Yahoo! <br>> is tolerating criminal acts.<br>> <br>> Sincerely, RJG<br>> <br>> -----------------<br>> <br>> Joao, I ask you you to help. Any way It's my birthday today.<br>> <br>> Ralf<br>></div>
