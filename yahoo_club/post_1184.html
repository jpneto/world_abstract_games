    <div>Hello Mark.  I am assuming you are the same person who wrote for Games<br>Journal and wrote the Defining the Abstract article in 2000.  If so, I<br>would like to have you give input here, and give a seal of approval<br>for what would qualify as acceptable abstracts for tournament<br>structure.  I have tried to encompass as much as your article into a<br>definition of a Standard IAGO abstract, plus add more criterion, and<br>would like your seal of approval on it (since someone on here pretty<br>much said I am clueless in knowing what an abstract strategy game is).<br><br>I am at a situation where I want the organization to function, and not<br>fly apart by going down a path where it morphs into a general<br>boardgame association.  But also, need to look at pragmatic situations<br>like considering representing Chess960, eventhough it isn't a<br>Combinatorial Game Theorist approved abstract strategy game (because<br>people are playing it).<br><br>If it is you, can you please speak up here?<br><br>Thank you for your time...<br>- Rich</div>
