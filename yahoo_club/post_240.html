    <div>ANNOUNCING THE 3rd PIECEPACK GAME DESIGN COMPETITION<br><br><br>Theme:  Changing Landscapes<br>Closes: 17 January 2003<br>Prize:  *Hand-made 4x4 game board, bits, case, and instructions.<br>        *2nd edition piecepack with rules CD-ROM from Mesomorph Games.<br>        *piecepack trophy cloth custody.<br><br>Sponsor: Mesomorph Games<br>Judge:   Michael Schoessow<br><br><br>DESIGN THEME:<br><br>The design theme for the 3rd piecepack game design competition is Changing<br>Landscapes. All game submissions must be for board games that utilize a<br>mutable board. In other words, the board configuration must change in some<br>fashion during the course of the game. There are many possibilities. Some of<br>them are:<br><br>*The board can grow or be added to turn by turn.<br>*The board can grow or shrink depending on gameplay.<br>*Tile relative positions can change depending on what is setting on them.<br>*Portions of the board can undergo sliding or some other form of shifting.<br>*Tile orientation or rotation angle can change.<br>*Tiles can change from face-up to face-down.<br>*Tiles can be stacked, unstacked, or leaned.<br>*Tiles can slide or move on top of other tiles or bridge across other tiles.<br>*Tile grouping can change.<br>*The board can be a changing array of tokens.<br><br>These are general ideas that designers may utilize in some form if they<br>wish, but they are not limited to them. There are numerous commercial board<br>games with mutable boards. Some diverse examples, selected to help stimulate<br>ideas are, Amazing Labyrinth, Zertz, Mississippi Queen, Agora, Carcasonne,<br>Carolus Magnus, Tally Ho!, Work or Golf, and Dominoes. Each of these<br>illustrates a different clever way to incorporate a changing board into a<br>game, and designers may make use of or modify these ideas for their entries<br>if they wish. Descriptions and pictures can be found at<br>www.boardgamegeek.com or at www.funagain.com or at various other game<br>websites.<br><br><br>THE PRIZE:<br><br>There are several parts to the prize. <br><br>Mike Schoessow will build a hardwood 4x4 gridded game board, that can be<br>used for playing various strategy games, along with a case and appropriate<br>bits plus a collection of game instructions.<br><br>Mesomorph Games will contribute a 2nd Edition piecepack Game System with<br>CD-ROM containing instructions for a variety of games playable with the<br>piecepack, including those submitted and released for this competition.<br><br>The winner also receives custody of the Trophy Cloth, a card-table-sized<br>tablecloth with a color piecepack suit emblem embroidered on each side of<br>the table. This passes from the winner of one contest to the winner of the<br>next, with each one signing and dating the cloth before passing it on<br>following the closing of the next competition.<br><br><br>RULE DETAILS:<br><br>1) Submitted games must incorporate some non-trivial form of change to the<br>board configuration during at least part of the game. Non-trivial means that<br>the change must have a significant effect on the gameplay.<br><br>2) Shuffling the tiles and laying them out to form the board as the first<br>action in a game does not, by itself, constitute a non-trivial form of<br>change. A change in the configuration of pawns or tokens setting on the<br>board is also not considered a change in the board itself. <br><br>3) The game must utilize a piecepack and preferably should make use of some<br>of the unique aspects of the piecepack.<br><br>4) Judging will be subjective and based largely on how enjoyable and<br>interesting the game is (assuming it satisfies the rules), but other factors<br>will be taken into consideration. A changing board aspect that fits<br>naturally, seamlessly, and centrally into the gameplay is desirable. Clever<br>use of piecepack components is desirable. Attributes of gameplay that will<br>be considered positively include depth, clarity, decisiveness, and elegance.<br>A compact, well organized rule set is also desirable but not, of course, at<br>the expense of good gameplay of rule clarity.<br><br>5) Games may make use of additional bits (such as money for example), or of<br>other game systems in addition to the piecepack, or may require the use of<br>two or more piecepacks.<br><br>6) Abstract games and games with well integrated themes (with or without<br>elements of chance) are equally welcome.<br><br>7) Solitaire games, 2-player games, and multi-player games are equally<br>welcome.<br><br>8) Games (rule sets) should be sent to Karol@... before 17 January<br>2003, 12:00 noon PST (20:00 UTC). Karol will send confirmation back to the<br>author, then cover the author's identity and send the game on. Between 10<br>January and 17 January confirmation will be within 24 hours. For earlier<br>submissions confirmation may occasionally take longer. Judging will be<br>blind; the play testers and judge will not find out the authors' identities<br>until after the winner has been selected.<br><br>9) Karol will also proofread the rules and send the proofed version or<br>corrections to the author for approval. Please note that she will not be<br>judging content, just adjusting grammar, punctuation, and spelling (highly<br>desirable before the game is added to the CD-ROM). If the proofed copy is<br>not acceptable to the author or Karol does not receive the go-ahead before<br>12:00 PST 17 January, judging will be based on the original rules as<br>submitted.<br><br>10) The winner of the competition will be announced on 17 February 2003. If<br>the quantity of game submissions is larger than anticipated this date may be<br>pushed back. <br><br>11) Designers are encouraged to submit their games early. There will be no<br>penalty or stigma for sending in changes or updates to your game rules up to<br>the 17 January deadline, and entrants are encouraged to submit updates based<br>on their own continued play testing. Karol would appreciate it if areas of<br>change in rule updates were pointed out.<br><br>12) Game entries may be in PDF form, in HTML format, in MS Word files, or in<br>plain text with accompanying JPGs, or GIFs if required for figures.<br><br>13) The submission must be freely redistributable. Authors are free to<br>retain copyright.<br><br>14) The submission(s) must have a header containing the Title, Version<br>Number, Date, Number of Players, Approximate Length of Game, Equipment<br>Required, Author, Copyright, and Licensing Information.<br><br><br>The author of the wining game also wins the opportunity to define and judge<br>the next piecepack game design competition and arrange for the prize if he<br>or she wishes. Agreement to this is not a requirement for entry however, and<br>if the winner does not wish to judge the next competition he or she can<br>suggest another judge, or we can improvise.<br><br>Submitted games will be added to the piecepack.org site following the close<br>of the competition.<br><br><br>Questions and comments are always welcome. Preferably post them to the<br>piecepack discussion group (I encourage entrants to join the group if they<br>have not yet. Go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/piecepack). Good luck and<br>much encouragement to all who would like to participate. I'm looking forward<br>to play testing some fun new games!<br><br>Mike Schoessow</div>
