    <div>Hi <br><br>Your game rule basics seem very<br>interesting and simple. However there are some<br>questions:<br><br>a) Isolated stones cannot be captured! You already<br>said that is to give some protection to them, but I<br>wonder if both players will not place stone after stone<br>isolated from each other, while that is possible. In that<br>sense, a 19x19 board seems to big. Perhaps a 13x13 or<br>even a 9x9 if the game is deep enough. However, I<br>would say to drop this restriction.<br><br>b) Perhaps<br>the move part should not be restricted to any other<br>rule. A player just moves one stone if he thinks it's<br>good to do so. That would eliminate all recursive<br>problems that Claude mentioned. The double move (move and<br>deploy) seems good in order to get a faster<br>game.<br><br>c) why restrict the range of the next piece? Why not<br>let players use Go openings to deploy their armies?<br>It seems more versatile that way.<br><br>d) "The two<br>sides get one chance in the game to switch<br>sides."<br><br>This is my main objection. You should restrict this<br>rule! Just give a 1-move or 3-move equalizer to White,<br>or state "The two sides get one chance in the game<br>to switch sides, ***while there are no captures<br>made*** ", but even that seems too long-term. It destroys<br>any willingness to create winning<br>strategies.<br><br>I hope I'm not intruding too much on your game.<br>Just trying to spot and clean some strange exceptions<br>:-) But "The Way" feels like a very nice game. After<br>the rules are 'settled', I can play a game with you,<br>if you want!<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Pedro Neto</div>
