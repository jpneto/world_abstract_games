    <div>I believe that TruthForum is attempting to forge the term 'abstract' <br>into the term 'concrete'.  By consistantly insisting that abstract <br>games conform to pre-defined conditions, this will stifle creativity <br>and eventually lead to stagnation.<br><br>There are many developers who wish that their games will be <br>recognized as the epitome of its genre.  Often they attempt to <br>achieve this by completely eliminating others from such competition.  <br>The easy process is to define them out of the running.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>By the way, Chinese Checkers is the common name for the game and is <br>easily recognized by most players.  It is neither derogatory to those <br>of Sino-descent nor is an inappropriate reference for the game.  <br>TruthForum should spend more effort defending his original premise, <br>rather than nit-picking others.  Next, he'll be asking that we define <br>the meaning of the word "is".</div>
