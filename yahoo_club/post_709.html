    <div>Hi Ralf,<br><br>Glad to hear that you're enjoying the book! <br><br>Thanks for giving further details on Connections (which I've called <br>McNamara's Game). I didn't make the connection that these were the <br>same game and will add this to my errata list. <br><br>The book does in fact contain Gomollu and Dvonn. These are included <br>in Figure 10.1, the list of Connection-Related games, which are <br>those games in which connection plays a significant but not <br>exclusive role. <br><br>Thanks for mentioning Blox, I'll check it out. If you find any other <br>games I've missed please let me know.<br><br>In terms of games such as Trax and Havannah that cross more than one <br>category, I'd agree that these can be regarded bastard games with <br>their feet in more than one group. I simply chose to put them in the <br>group that I considered to be the dominant to simplify their <br>classification.<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron</div>
