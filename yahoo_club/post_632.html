    <div>> I have sent you three messages to the emails you give at <br>> your "World of Abstract Games" webpage and your "Game Design" <br>> webpage:<br>> <br>> jpn@d...<br>> jpnREMOVESPAM@d...<br>> vasco@u...<br><br>indeed, only 'jpn@...' works now... There are some places <br>with the 'vascog' email written in stone bits :)<br> <br>> I have received no reply, and assume there is a problem with the <br>> email delivery.  Perhaps you could post a reply here.  We have <br>> communicated by email several times in the past.<br><br>I didn't receive any email from you, I guess it's the spam filter. <br>Nowadays, more than 90% of my email is garbage and sometimes a good <br>one is caught in the automatic destruction.<br> <br>> Clearly, something has gone wrong with "Abstract Games Magazine".  <br>> The webpage has not been updated in ages, and Issue 17 was never <br>> mailed out.  I am reluctant to send mail to Kerry, because he is <br>> probably flooded by emails now.<br>> <br>> If you have any information about the situation, please post it <br>> here for me.  Thankyou.<br><br>I also sent an email to Kerry some months ago (with no reply) and the <br>only thing I know is the message posted by Kerry at r.g.a stating <br>that the magazine will be out despite the huge delay. I really don't <br>know when and if it will really happen. We can only hope...<br><br>Joao</div>
