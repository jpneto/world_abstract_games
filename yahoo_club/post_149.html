    <div>It occurred to me that the GRYB playing field would make an <br>interesting Go game.<br><br>Taking that the liberties would be considered as those nodes which <br>are adjacent.  A stone would have two liberties upon a particular <br>quarternary, with possibly one liberty above and four below.<br><br>All the rules of Go would apply.</div>
