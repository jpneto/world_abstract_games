    <div>The term "abstract games" is not about "hardware", it's about <br>"software". It doesn't matter whether a game is played with dices, <br>cards, tiles, skittles, seeds, stones, "chess" pieces, a board or <br>not. What really matters is the concept on which the game is based.<br><br>Basically an "abstract game" comes very close to the definition of <br>a "combinatorial game" as explained by R.K. Guy in "What is a game?", <br>published in: R.J. Nowakowski (ed.). Games of No Chance. Cambridge <br>1998.<br><br>There are a few differences. So what is an "abstract game"?<br><br>An "abstract game" satisfies the following conditions:<br><br>1. There are just two parties, often called Left and Right. There can <br>   be no question of coalitions.<br>   Examples: Chess; Pair Go (four players, but just two parties!)<br><br>2. There are several positions.<br>   Examples: Salta (finitely many); Trax (infinitely many)<br><br>3. There are clearly defined rules.<br><br>4. Left and right never move simultaneously.<br><br>5. There are clearly defined winning conditions. A game may also end <br>   in a draw. <br><br>6. Both players know what is going on; there is complete information.<br><br>7. There are no chance moves.<br><br>8. Manual dexterity is of no importance.<br><br>9. Speed (i.e. moves per time) is of no importance.<br><br><br>These are not "abstract games".<br><br>Tamsk (speed), Tetris (speed), Icehouse (s=EDmultaneous moves), <br>Senterej (simultaneous moves), Pool Billiard (manual dexterity), <br>Jenga (manual dexterity), Skat (incomplete information), Kriegsspiel <br>(incomplete information), Mastermind (incomplete information), <br>Backgammon (chance moves).  <br><br><br>These are "abstract games":<br><br>Cube Checkers, Chase (both played with dices)<br>Trax (played with tiles, but without a board)<br>Kiuthi (played with seeds)<br>Konane (played with stones)<br>Matt (played with cards)<br>Shatar (played with "chess" pieces)<br>Halma (played with Skittles)<br><br><br>TruthForum</div>
