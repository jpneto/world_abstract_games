You told<br>people in your underscore group that I was supporting illegal<br>activities (if unable to be justified, you possibly could be sued for<br>libel, by the way for saying this).  And you called for your boycott<br>pretty much.  This was because I didn't side with you to stage a<br>crusade against Mark to keep him out of IAGO and blacklist him.  Why<br>else did you kick me out of your underscore stacking group?  You did,<br>and posted a message.  Why Ralf, unless you want IAGO to fail, because<br>Mark has some association with it?  <br> <br>> I find it odd that games should be removed for personal reasons<br>> whether they were designed by me or Steere. <br><br>When people say they "refuse to support IAGO" or tell people to avoid<br>it, what conclusion do I reach about their games?  You have just said<br>you don't want any of your games in any IAGO tournaments, thus, it<br>sounds like you don't want them anywhere near IAGO.  Feel free to see<br>the master list and how many games are on there.  I don't need any<br>headaches in having to remove and put back anything there.  So, you<br>say you don't want IAGO supported, then IAGO will remove anything of<br>yours that might support it.  They are your games after all.<br><br>> I'm writing a book about good mancala games, and Steere's Diffusion is<br>> one of those included. It doesn't matter that I dislike Steere -<br>> however he behaves it doesn't change or affect his game in any way.<br><br>That is your choice.  Apparently how Mark behaves, and your view of it<br>does impact ME and IAGO somehow.  Otherwise, the mystery of why you<br>boot me out of the underscore stacking group remains.<br><br>> "I know IAGO could benefit from more Mancala variants." <br>> I agree.<br><br>Yes they could, but they won't be by someone who has kicked me out of<br>their group, and is pretty much hostile towards IAGO.  If you care to<br>explain your hostility, besides some oddball, "You support illegal<br>activity", then we can get your games in.  But, as of now, all I see<br>you as, is someone who is hostile towards IAGO and wants it to fail. <br>With this mentality, I don't see why your games would belong anywhere<br>near IAGO or in its knowledge bases.  Ralf, why would you want your<br>games anywhere near IAGO if you disagree with it, and pretty much hate<br>it?  <br><br>Anyhow, I have a dozen of other more important things than trying to<br>beg with you and even figure you out.  If Chess and other abstract<br>strategy games were on TV, and in the place poker was now (minus the<br>laws against it being played), then I would have far less to do.  But,<br>as of now, I don't have that luxury.  My time is far better spent<br>trying to figure out how to get players to China for the World Mind<br>Sport Games, than hunting down any of your Mancala games and getting<br>them in the Master List actually (this is complete with the off-chance<br>risk someone might find it and want to do an IAGO World Tour event<br>with it).<br><br>Well, I will leave it with you.  If you don't care that games are in<br>IAGO, and would rather IAGO not have your games show up in any of<br>their tournaments, they won't be on the Master List.  But, you have a<br>different view, I can get them in there, and also even list your book<br>in the resources when it is done.  But, this is up to you.  As for me,<br>I have more important things to do.</div>
