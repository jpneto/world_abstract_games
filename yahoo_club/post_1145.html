    <div>The purpose of this post is to come up with a unifying model to<br>describe all abstract strategy games.  Please review this and comment<br>on it.<br><br>[Key elements]<br>There are multiple key elements that define all abstract strategy<br>games. These elements are:<br>1. Turns. A turn is defined an action or a series of actions that a<br>player can perform that change the state of pieces in a game.<br>2. Players. Actors in a game who change the states of pieces in the game.<br>3. Pieces. These are items players control in the game that are used<br>to define state of game.<br>4. Board (play area). Board is a term used to describe area where<br>pieces are positioned and interact with one another. A board may also<br>represent a Board with no spaces.<br>5. Null (off play area/board). This is used to descibe where pieces<br>are located that are not on the board. Null can be defined and<br>configured many different ways. It can consist of a queue or multiple<br>queues.<br><br>[Turn attributes]<br>* Sequencing of turns:<br>- Turn order: Only one player may perform actions at a time. Rules<br>governing when order of players moving.<br>- Real-time: All players perform their actions at same time.<br>- Simultaneous: All players plan and record all their moves and then<br>they the moves are acted out at same time.<br>* Information level: Degree to which what players do is known. Perfect<br>means everything is revealed to all at same time. Hidden means that<br>some or all of moves are revealed, or only revealed when certain<br>criterion are met.<br><br>[Players]<br>* Types:<br>- Intelligent (aware of game conditions and acts upon information in<br>game to adjust plans)<br>- Unintelligent (Unaware of game conditions and acts either<br>deterministic, reactive or random). Can act as a mix of all three.<br>   1. Deterministic (unaware of conditions in game, and acts<br>according. Non-reactive, objective driven)<br>   2.Reactive (deterministically, by rules, acts based upon conditions<br>in game, but not goal-driven)<br>   3. Random (unaware of conditions of game, and acts unpredictably)<br><br>* Relationships:<br>- Enemies: Has goals opposing other players in the game.<br>- Partners (Allies): Share common goals, and win conditions.<br>- Neutral: Has no goals in game (can't win).<br><br>[Piece attributes]<br>* Ownership (who owns the piece): Piece(s) may be owned by one or more<br>players. Ownership is defined as a player being able to manipulate a<br>piece during their turn.<br>* Traits: States of a piece that determines how it is governed by rules.<br><br>[Board attributes]<br>* Discreteness of spaces:<br>- Discrete (finite): Multiple spaces that fit distinct piece on each<br>other.<br>- Non-Discrete (Infinite): Can be argued it is a "spaceless" board.<br>Boundaries are defined by pieces, not spaced on board.<br>* Boundness of board:<br>- Board is finite: Board has boundaries<br>- Board has infinite number of spaces (non-discrete): Board is<br>expandable, and has boundaries extended.<br>* Traits: Attributes of board spaces (and board) that are governed by<br>rules, and impact how rules govern pieces.<br>- Static: Attributes don't change<br>- Dynamic: Attributes can change<br><br>[Relationship of Board to Pieces]<br>* Unispace: Each space on board may contain only one piece.<br>* Multispace: Each space on board may contain multiple pieces. Rules<br>regarding limits to quantities is required (even if unlimited).<br>Mancala and stacking games apply to this.<br>- Queued (stack): Pieces enter and leave in a sequence from one another.<br>- Pile (Mancala games): pieces freely leave or gather independent of<br>each other, not in sequence.<br><br>Rules govern which pieces may be grouped together on which spaces, and<br>leaving.<br><br>[Null attributes]<br>* Types:<br>- Void: Pieces into Null never return to game (eliminated).<br>- Single space: Has capacity of one. Prior pieces sent to equivalent<br>of Void (described above)<br>- Pool: Pieces can enter back into play into play in any order<br>- Queue: Pieces enter back into play into a sequence.<br>- Multiple Queue: Each player has his own queue.<br><br>[Proposed Categorization by C.D Rodeffer]<br>Board Target (claim, occupy, connect or capture a specific goal space<br>or spaces)<br>Piece Target (claim, capture, immobilize, eliminate or checkmate a<br>specific goal piece or pieces)<br>Board Majority (claim, occupy, connect or capture the most (or more<br>important) goal spaces)<br>Piece Majority (claim, capture, immobilize, eliminate checkmate the<br>most (or more important) goal pieces)<br><br>Claim, occupy, connect, capture, immobilize, eliminate<br><br><br>[Categories of abstract strategy games]<br>Classes of game types (based on Zillions site, used for Athlon<br>determination):<br>1. Escape (Breakthrough/Race) [Location of pieces to positions on<br>board matters]: Players try to get a piece(s) onto key positions on board.<br>* Bi-sided (Race): Both players try to get from one location to<br>another with one or more of their pieces. Arimaa is here. Both sides<br>have key positions to get to. Locations can be identical or different.<br>* Uni-sided (Breakthrough: Navigate/block): One player tries to get<br>piece or pieces to location(s) on board and opponent tries to stop<br>them. Tablut is here.<br><br>In Escape (Breakthrough/race), win positions for pieces on board is<br>absolute. Victory is occupation 100% of all critical areas.<br><br><br>2. Territory (Occupy/Claim): Player tries to control/own most spaces<br>on board. Go and Othello count here.<br>* Occupy (absolute): Players occupy spaces directly. Othello applies here.<br>* Claim (relative): Players try to own spaces indirectly, based on<br>position of pieces on board, according to some rules. Go applies here.<br><br>In Territory, ownership of board spaces determines winner. Victory is<br>a control/own majority of all critical areas.<br><br><br>3. Positioning (Chain/Cluster or Connection/Arrangement) [Relationship<br>of pieces' locations to each other matters]: Players configure groups<br>of pieces on the board in some manner.<br>* Connection (chain): Players try to connect two or more spaces on the<br>board with a chain of their pieces. Hex and Twixt are here.<br>* Arrangement (cluster): Players try to get their pieces in a certain<br>configuration. Lines of Action, Groups and Teeko are here.<br><br>In Positioning, win positions for pieces on board is relative.<br>Relative here means pieces could end up partly being on absolute<br>spots. But the relative positions are governed by a set of rules.<br><br><br>4. Elimination (Capture/Immobilization) [Quantity of usable pieces on<br>board matters]: Players seek to capture or immobilize one or more of<br>opponent's piece(s).<br>* Royal: Players try to capture or put a particular opponent's piece<br>or all of a type of pieces where piece(s) are threatened and into a<br>place they can't escape capture (checkmate). This is for chess, chess<br>variants, Shogi, Chinese chess, Ploy, kinglet, extinction chess, etc=85<br>* Multipiece: Players try to eliminate (or immobilize) all, or a<br>number, of an opponent's pieces (in general, not) before their<br>opponent. Checkers fits here.<br><br>In Elimination, win condition are piece(s) in Null (meaning not on<br>board) or piece(s) are immobilized. Try to eliminate something for win.<br><br><br>5. Fortuna: This is a unique category. It is for games that are less<br>than perfect/pure abstract strategy games. Games with either hidden<br>information or a randomizer fit here. To be part of IAGO, a game in<br>the Fortuna category either belongs in Hidden or Tali, but not both.<br>* Hidden: These are games where players don't have perfect<br>information. Kriegspiel (Dark Chess) and Stratego would fit here.<br>* Tali: These are games where a player uses a randomizer before they<br>start their turn, such as dice. Backgammon and Parchisi fit here.<br>Tali is Latin for Knucklebones (a type of dice used in ancient roman<br>games). Games randomized at start of game, before either player moves,<br>don't fit here, but can still be an official game for IAGO, provided<br>that they are fair to all players (either board layout is balanced,<br>players have free setup that is fair, or players get to play all set<br>ups by all players in the game).<br><br><br>[Action types]: Move, capture, place<br>* Move: transferring location of piece on board from one location to<br>another. A move can also be defined as moving a piece to the Null<br>area, and then back onto board in following turn (with the prior<br>position recorded). Rules governing movement are based on position of<br>piece on board at start of move, the type of piece it is (or other<br>pieces are), and/or the relationship of the piece to other piece(s) in<br>the game.<br>* Capture: Transfer of piece from Board to Null. Pieces may either<br>return to board (capture) or not (eliminate). A capture may change<br>atttributes of piece as it goes into Null (such as ownership).<br>- Immobilize is a contrary subset of capture, where piece stays on<br>board, but is incapable of being used by its owner.<br>* Place: Transfer from Null to Board.<br><br><br>[Elements that reduce determinism of players in an abstract strategy game]<br>1. Degree playing environment is not controlled by players<br>(randomized). This involves pre-game set up and post game set up.<br>Also, randomization of player set up fits into this. Players having<br>complete control over where they place pieces doesn't count as<br>randomization. Only exception for randomization would be the<br>determining of turn order/player seating may be determined at random<br>(ideally it would be preferred this not happen).<br>2. Degree information to players is perfect. This means known at start<br>of turn or the game, players know the exact conditions they are<br>facing, and expected results based on what moves they make.<br>3. Variants of board environment, and degree players have control over<br>it. In a case where players have a fixed set up and the board set up<br>is randomly determined, unless the set up is balanced for all players.<br>4. Number of players. More than two leads to more uncertainty. It is<br>implied that there is a minimum of two players for a game.<br><br>[Elements of a game that is 100% deterministic (pure abstract)]<br>1. Playing environment: no randomness. Players either control their<br>set up of pieces, or they are fixed (not randomly determined). All<br>players in the game are intelligent.<br>2. No hidden information.<br>3. The board is identical every game, or at least symmetric in its set<br>up so that it is fair to all players.<br>4. The game is played with two players only.<br><br><br>[Other issues]<br>Stacking games(?): I personally would include this under what other<br>category they belong to like, Elimination. Focus and Byte would<br>possible be here. These would usually be best fit under elimination<br>games, unless like Dipole, then that is an Elimination game. This<br>could possibly relate to sowing games.<br>Sowing games: Pieces start in a pile, and are distributed. Games in<br>the Mancala family. Also included would be games like Swahili or Space<br>Walk.<br>* Solution: Have classic abstract strategy games in their own<br>division, not codified like this. Also the idea of board attributes<br>covers this.<br><br>Also note that a game could combine one or more of the above. The<br>trick is to see what is most dominant, or perhaps have an order of<br>priority. A game where you have breakthrough OR capture, would likely<br>be just breakthrough, because capturing is just a way to prevent a<br>person from breaking through. Using this reasoning, elimination games<br>will be classified as something else, if they have another class of<br>games they belong to.<br><br>Misere' versions of game fit into mirror versions of what they are<br>opposite. A game where you try to get all your pieces or all pieces of<br>one type of yours onto the board would be a be a misere' version of<br>capture/immobilize. A game where you try to get all your pieces off a<br>certain spaces on the board would be a misere' version of<br>breakthrough/race. A game where you force your opponent into a certain<br>configuration is a misere' version of chain/group game.<br><br><br>[Categories/Classes/Divisions of games to be played]<br>1. Classic (and Classic variants): There are classics such as chess<br>and go. There is also variants on classics, like Speed chess,<br>bughouse, and mini-Go. These games are one off the main games and I<br>don't believe have champions, and no association to promote them. Also<br>fitting in here would be the idea of -athalons. Multigame events where<br>players play a set of very different games. Like someone plays speed<br>chess, mini-go and another game (say checkers) as a classic triathalon.<br>2. Standard (Modern): These games use classic game equipment, but<br>things completely different. Mark's designs fit into this<br>particularly. These games center around a standardize set of equipment<br>for IAGO.<br>3. Alternative (Commercial): These games are usually one game<br>standalone products, which require purchasing of separate equipment.<br>If a game is not able to be played with standard classic game<br>equipment, then it would fit here.</div>
