    <div>>The possibility to play where we have already<br>played - to increase a fraction - >makes the game<br>very different and quite ugly after all [..] So I<br>would like to <br>>forbid it, both with fractions<br>and with whole stones.<br><br>So, you are saying that<br>after a fraction is dropped, you cannot increase<br>it?<br>Hmmm... the game gets more stable (and faster) but<br>perhaps we are losing many things with that<br>restriction...<br><br>>As a consequence fractions are less an advantage and<br>there is a interestingly <br>>sharper dilemma about<br>whether playing them or playing whole stones.<br><br>Only<br>by trying and playing, we can reach better<br>conclusions<br><br>>But I would say fractions of stones are enough to<br>define territories.<br><br>That should be a must.<br>"Weaker frontiers, but still valid territory!"<br>I think<br>you should base the game on this principle. Valid<br>territory<br>when counting, but weak frontiers open to attack until<br>the game ends.<br><br>>until White's safe whole<br>stones OOO capture Black's structure (the OOOs live<br><br>>through smaller fractional<br>Xs).<br><br>Right!<br><br>>> write something like '1x3' (meaning 1 + 1/3), so<br>'xn' is the same as '0xn'<br>>We also need<br>fractions like 2x/3. <br><br>My mistake!!! I wanted to<br>write 1x1 meaning 1 + 1/3<br><br>>- using the kind<br>of decimal point Joao suggests - but writing down<br>the 2, not<br>> the 3. We would write x2, x1, and<br>1x for (0 + 2/3)x, (0 + 1/3)x, <br>>and (1 +<br>0/3)x respectively;<br><br>I really prefer this one! It<br>reminds me of two different decimal points (x and o),<br>which is a nice variant of arithmetic's ;-)<br><br>Joao</div>
