    <div>> What was that latest kludge in a long series of failed attempts to<br>> make 55 Stones playable?  <br><br>I never invented a game which is spelled that way. If you mean<br>55Stones, it is obviously played by some people and one of the best<br>known non-commercial mancala variants at Board GameGeek.<br><br>I know that you're mentally disturbed, so I'm not going to reply your<br>primitive utterances which will surely come as one of your greatest<br>weaknesses (besides your racist Neo-Nazi attitudes) is that you can't<br>keep your mouth when it would be wise to do so.<br><br>Ralf<br><br><br>Like a reverse, double pie, 1/2 point<br>> backflip with chocolate sprinkles?  If it doesn't work, let it go. <br>> Nobody wants to play it anyway.<br>></div>
