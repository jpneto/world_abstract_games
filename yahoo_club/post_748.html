    <div>> I was told at the Toy Fair in Essen last<br>> year that Rodeffer wrote an article on <br>> Pacru for AGM.<br><br>This is incorrect. During the time between the Essen fair and the<br>Nuremburg fair, I had custody of (but did not actually own) a very<br>nice copy of Pacru (the first copy to travel to the Americas),<br>courtesy of the game's author. After several games, I wrote a few very<br>brief comments about Pacru on the BoardGameGeek site before passing<br>the game along to another reviewer here in the USA, who will in turn<br>pass it along to another reviewer, etc. But I didn't write an article<br>on Pacru for AGM, or at least I haven't yet.<br><br>However, I did interview James Ernest for the magazine, and I have<br>contacted several other designers and/or publishers for potential<br>future interviews. I also submitted short reviews of James Kyle's<br>piecepack and Reiner Knizia's "Dice Games, Properly Explained" for<br>AGM. Unfortunately, all of those pieces are now fairly outdated.<br><br>> I have sent two articles to Kerry two<br>> years ago, one about Qubic, the other<br>> about Tricolor (a forgotten German<br>> stacking game from the early 1970s).<br><br>Ralf, I recently acquired copies of both Qubic and Tricolor, and I<br>would be interested in what you had to say about them.<br><br>Clark</div>
