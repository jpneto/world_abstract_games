    <div>This is great! Thanks, Ralf, for taking the initiative.<br><br>I really do think stacking games deserve special attention (same as<br>connection games recently got), not only because they are natural<br>extensions of the conventional flat gameboard - and therefore form a<br>separate field of research. Also, have a look at them physically: they<br>are beautiful :-)<br><br>Dieter<br><br><br>Ralf schrieb:<br>> The Yahoo!Group "Stacking Games" has been revived.
