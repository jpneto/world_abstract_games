    <div>I don't have Blokus yet, but am considering getting it. Can anyone <br>tell me whether it can be played as a 2-player game, or do you have <br>to have 3 or 4? It looks to me as if all the pieces from just two <br>players would fit easily on the 400-square board, which would mean <br>that (in principle) you could have draws, if I'm remembering the <br>rules correctly. Unless you play a 2-player game on a smaller board, <br>perhaps a 12x12?</div>
