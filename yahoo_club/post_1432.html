    <div>There's a new game at Boardspace, called Traboulet.  Traboulet is a<br>marble pushing game, mechanically similar to Abalone, but a completely<br>different game.  The physical game is one of those mechanical marvels<br>that's fun just to use.  The robots are ready to "introduce" you to<br>the game.<br>http://boardspace.net/english/about_kuba.html<br><br>There will be a Hive (with Mosquito) tournament starting June 1.  As<br>with last year's tournament, John Yianni has promised to award a<br>trophy to the winner, and also, mosquitos to the top 16 players in the<br>tournament.   This is already sure to be the biggest tournament ever<br>at boardspace, but I will cap the participation at 128 players.<br>http://boardspace.net/cgi-bin/tournament-signup.cgi?tournamentid=3D13<br><br>Finally, there will be a Zertz tournament targeted to beginners, also<br>starting June 1 or when the first 16 players have signed up.  The<br>established master players will not be playing, so the competition<br>should be friendly and not overwhelming for newcomers.<br>http://boardspace.net/cgi-bin/tournament-signup.cgi?tournamentid=3D12</div>
