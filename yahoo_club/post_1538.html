    <div>hi, I am new here ... I created a game that no other game (maybe GO)<br>can beat in regard of its complexity and excitements ... it's called Massacre Chess and is played with a great success at brainking.com ...<br>Idea is simple ... we use regular chess board and every player has 8 bishops, 8 knights, 8 rooks and 8 queens ... all of the pieces are randomly distributed on the board ... white start capturing any of black pieces and black continue the same way (capturing is mandatory, no other moves are allowed) ... player who has no more moves loses the game ... simple ? try it ... if the game continues till the end, white always will be the lat piece left on the board (so black loses) ...<br>here is the link to my game at brainking.com:<br>http://brainking.com/en/GameRules?tp=3D128<br>good luck ...<br>Andy.</div>
