    <div>Mark,<br><br>I too think Jade sounds like an excellent game. If you (and Larry, and any others) are able to come to Ann Arbor for this year's U*Con Abstract Games tournament, I would love to play a game either before or after. What size grid have you found to make Jade the most interesting?<br><br>Also, Dan recently completed the ZRF that I started for Proton a couple of years ago. It's currently awaiting approval, but if you'd like to beta test a copy, please let me know.<br><br>Clark<br><br>________________________________________________________________<br>The best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!<br>Surf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!<br>Only $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!</div>
