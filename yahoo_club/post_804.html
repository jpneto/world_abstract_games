    <div>This message was rather weird:<br> <br>> 1) Count the number of pieces in the row/column/diagonal,<br>> 2) Make sure the destination point is that distance away, <br><br>Count? You see it at a glance!<br><br><br>> 3) Remember whether it was your pieces or your opponent's pieces <br>> that you can jump over, then<br>> 4) Remember whether it was your pieces or your opponent's pieces <br>> that you can jump over.<br><br>3) and 4) is identical!<br>The opponent's pieces can block your movement, your own pieces not. <br>What can be more simple?<br><br>Very strange response!<br><br>=</div>
