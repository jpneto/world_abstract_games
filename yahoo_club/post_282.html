    <div>I've recently posted the rule set for an unusual abstract strategy <br>game on the Board Game Design Forum at www2.communityzero.com/bgdf <br>(click on the Submitted Games section). The game is played on a 4x4 <br>board, yet achieves good depth by combining mutable pieces with the <br>use of two special pieces called Catalysts that are used to activate <br>the powers of other pieces. The game has been reasonably well play-<br>tested so that I consider it "done", but I would still be interested <br>in hearing comments, pro or con, from anyone who's interest is piqued <br>enough to give it a try. The components required are a 4x4 board and <br>some Ice House pyramids (or 3 sizes in 2 colors of some other <br>stackable pieces).<br><br>--Mike Schoessow<br>mschoessow@...</div>
