    <div>If you live in the USA, you could perhaps help me. I need the rules <br>of two games.<br><br><br>The "Mancala Gallery" at <br><br>http://www.abstractstrategy.com/mancala-g.html<br><br>shows several modern editions of Mancala variants.<br><br>1.<br>"Conga" is a well-known German two-dimensional Mancala variant.<br><br>2.<br>"Mandinka" appears to be identical to Oware / Warri.<br><br>3.<br>"Oh-Wah-Ree" is still very popular and its rules are published on the <br>web.<br><br>4.<br>"Sahara" by Pelikan is a Kalah variant with three seeds per hole <br>initially and played in rounds until 30, 40 or 50 points are reached. <br>The other rules are as in "Kalah".<br><br>5.<br>=84Kalaha" (Schmidt Spiele) is just German for =84Kalah", an American <br>game that was solved recently.<br><br>6.<br>The "Swahili Game" (Milton Bradley, 1968) and "Pass it on" (Selchow <br>and Righter's, 1978) are two mysterious games. I have no idea how to <br>play them, but they appear to be rather unusual.<br><br>Please, if you know the rules, could you please post them in our <br>group!<br><br>Ralf   <br><br><br>=</div>
