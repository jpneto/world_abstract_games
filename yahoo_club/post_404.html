    <div>Hi Doug,<br> <br>   Thanks for the info. I actually have heard of all those games but I had<br>forgotten that Proton is a 4x4, so I've added it to my list. Since I first<br>posted my query I've found some more games and various people have clued me<br>in to still others so my count is now up to 44 (including 7 of my own<br>design). I'm attaching my current list in case you're interested.<br> <br>   As to why:<br> <br>There is a generic non-patented game system out there called the piecepack.<br>It is to board games what a standard deck of cards is to card games (go to<br>www.piecepack.org <http://www.piecepack.org>  to learn more). Last year I<br>entered a game called Alien City in the Second Piecepack Design Competition<br>and ended up winning. The way these contests work, the winner has the option<br>to define the next contest theme and rules, and to judge the contest. He<br>also (based on the short tradition) provides the prize for the next winner.<br>I accepted, and subsequently launched the Changing Landscapes design<br>competition. I decided that the prize would be a hand-made hardwood 4x4<br>gridded playing board, bits, and case, along with rules for games that could<br>be played on it. One reason for this choice was because I knew of a couple<br>of 4x4 games I liked and also had designed two myself that fellow gamers<br>seemed to enjoy. Also, I wanted to give something game-related, unique, and<br>hand made, and this fit those requirements. Once I made this choice and<br>announced it however, it seemed like a good idea to look for more games to<br>fill out the rule booklet a bit. I worked on some more designs of my own and<br>I looked through the pictures from the list on the abstractstrategy website<br>and found quite a few more 4x4 games, but all I had for many of them was a<br>picture, sometimes along with author or publisher. After searching for more<br>information and finding rules for only a few of the games it occurred to me<br>that I could post on the spielfrieks and BoardGameDesign yahoogroups, asking<br>for information. This has actually worked out quite well because I've found<br>some pretty good games I didn't know of before. Many of them are also<br>playable with a piecepack or with some checkers or Ice House pyramids on a<br>board drawn on a piece of paper. Thus games like this are excellent travel<br>games because they are extremely portable without having to resort to tiny<br>inconvenient pieces.<br> <br> <br> <br>-Mike<br> <br> <br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: Doug Orleans [mailto:dougo@...]<br>Sent: Friday, February 28, 2003 5:13 PM<br>To: spielfrieks@yahoogroups.com<br>Cc: 'abstractgames@yahoogroups.com'; 'steves@...'<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: [spielfrieks] 4x4 Games<br><br><br><br>Michael Schoessow writes:<br>> I'm searching for names and descriptions of board games that utilize a 4x4<br>> gridded board.<br><br>Some more that haven't been mentioned:<br><br>Square Dance: http://boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=2934<br><http://boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=2934> <br>Gobblet: http://www.gobblet.com/ <http://www.gobblet.com/> <br>Proton: http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Proton/<br><http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Proton/> <br><br>Bosworth has a 4x4 playing field, but there are also 4x1 staging areas <br>along each edge, so perhaps this is better categorized as a 6x6 game.<br>http://www.otb-games.com/bosworth/ <http://www.otb-games.com/bosworth/> <br><br>Any special reason you're collecting 4x4 games?<br><br>--dougo@...<br><br><br>Yahoo!
