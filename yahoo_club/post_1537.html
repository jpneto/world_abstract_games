    <div>This is a new game of stalemate that makes use of the Immobilizer from Ultima.  Previously, I had created another game of stalemate called "Gorgon."  That was based on the Medusa piece from an unpuplished game that I invented back when I was 11 years old.  It was inspired by Greek Myths and every piece had its own special ability.  It was one of those games that was very imaginative and different, but completely unplayable.<br><br>The Immobilizer had properties in a similiar vein as my Gorgon. So I wanted to try and develop a game that uses the Immobilizer and would be a cousing to "Gorgon".  Another interesting twist that I've been wanting to try for awhile is that pieces on both sides all move in the same direction.  The rules for "Basilisk" can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/79682?do=3Dshow;id=3D1724</div>
