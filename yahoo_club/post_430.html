From this I'm going to assume <br>> Cross has some advantage in odd games by playing <br>> the center.<br>> <br>> So, play the center (say black).  <br><br>... What I have in mind also begins with Cross moving to the center <br>(or any cell on the short diagonal), but after that it's quite <br>simple: play symmetrically, the same color stone as Parallel, mirror-<br>reflected across the short diagonal. If Parallel makes a move on the <br>short diagonal, reply with any move to the short diagonal (either <br>color will do).<br><br>This wins for Cross, because it's impossible to have two parallel <br>groups in opposite colors connecting the same pair of opposite sides <br>on a board that is mirror-symmetric about the short diagonal.<br><br>Suppose you had one of the two needed chains, say a White one going <br>northeast-southwest. Then by mirror symmetry, there is also a White <br>chain going northwest-southeast, and obviously they must intersect on <br>the short diagonal: so that group constitutes a win for Cross. So <br>Parallel can't form either the Black or the White group he needs to <br>win, without also allowing Cross to form the 4-way connection that <br>wins for him.<br><br>So (another strike against my intuition!) as long as Cross goes <br>first, Parallel wins on all even boards and Cross wins on all odd <br>boards.<br><br>I'm inclined to think that this kind of symmetry strategy would also <br>be pretty potent even if Parallel went first on an odd board. Cameron <br>Browne suggests that Parallel might move first and place TWO stones <br>on his first turn, probably choosing two mirror-symmetric cells and <br>putting one black and one white stone (breaking symmetry from the <br>start). That may be the simplest rule tweak that works; we need to <br>experiment more.<br><br>My own thought was to allow Parallel to swap sides at ANY time when <br>Cross has just placed a stone that results in a position that is <br>symmetrical across the short diagonal: so instead of placing a stone, <br>he announces that he is now playing Cross. His opponent, who is now <br>playing Parallel, places the next stone. (If the player who is now <br>playing Cross makes another symmetric position, the player who is now <br>playing Parallel can swap again, of course.)<br><br>The latter option is less like the usual pie-rule fixes for other <br>connection games, but it seems to me that it does exactly what needs <br>to be done for the symmetry problem. A player can play symmetrically <br>for a move or two (or several) if he likes, but he can't rely on such <br>a strategy to win the game because it can be taken from him at any <br>point. It would also work on even boards, modified to prevent <br>Parallel from using symmetry through the center of the board.<br><br>Still another possible tweak would be to play "double-move Jade," <br>where the first player places one stone and all subsequent moves are <br>two stones; I think that makes a difficult game even harder, though. <br>More experimentation is called for, in my opinion.</div>
