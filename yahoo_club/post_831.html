    <div>>Well, I also agree. But aren't you restricting a bit too much your<br>>definition? Backgammon, AbChess and Tower of Power use stacks in a<br>>different way than Draughts. Stacks on those games do change sizes<br>>(even if they are homogenous in its composition).<br><br>Actually Tower of Power is a true stacking game, because you can capture <br>enemy stones by putting one of your own stone on top of them. My mistake!<br><br><br>>The point is that some games have fixed pieces and others do not.<br>>From these, some use homogenous stones and for others the stack's<br>>structure is relevant to its definition (this one would be Ralf's<br>>stacking games definition).<br>><br>>So I would guess we are talking about three different sets of games:<br>>* Non-stack games<br>>* Homogenous stack games<br>>* Heterogeneous stack games<br><br>You don't stack in most Mancala games. You could do that, but it would be <br>not very practical (try to stack 20+ stones). What you are talking about, <br>are games which have more than one piece at the same position. Some <br>heterogenous games are not stacking games (e.g. Avante, Shoo). It's not just <br>the structure which is important -- it's the position relative to each <br>other!<br><br>BTW, Octi appears to fit this definition, too. What do you think?<br><br>Ralf</div>
