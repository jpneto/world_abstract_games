    <div>In early 2004, Chessvariants.com will be hosting a multivariant<br>tournament played entirely on the Game Courier PBM system, located at<br><br>http://play.chessvariants.com/pbm/<br><br>Game Courier currently supports over 100 Chess variants, as well as<br>the occasional non-Chess abstract board game, and we are currently<br>conducting an approval poll to select which of these games will be<br>considered for the tournament. You may vote in this poll up through<br>December 31st.<br><br>After the first poll narrows down the list, we will conduct a second<br>poll asking you to rank your preferences. When this poll is over, we<br>will list the games to be played in the tournament and take some time<br>to let people sign up. Further details and a link to the poll, which<br>you can vote in online, are at<br><br>http://play.chessvariants.com/tournaments/gamecourier1.html</div>
