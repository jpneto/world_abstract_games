    <div>I'm playing with Bill Taylor some progressive Y games, and in one<br>of our discussions, he said:<br><br>"Many games do quite well with the progressive transformer, 1-2-3-4-<br>5...   But most have to be restricted in some way to keep the flavour <br>of the original game as much as possible, and prevent it becoming a <br>mere bludgeoning race.  So, chess retains check-stop, our new Go has <br>atari-stop, 1-2-2-2 Hex (and Y) is often played non-adjacent, and so <br>on."<br><br>I was wondering on the 'and so on'. In fact, chess has several <br>restriction flavors (scottish, italian, english and portuguese <br>variants, check them at <br>   http://www.chessvariants.com/multimove.dir/progressive.html )<br><br>Do any of you know any other progressive restrictions applied to some <br>other abstract game?<br><br>Joao<br><br>ps: btw, atari-stop Go, is just Go with progressive mutator 1-2-3-<br>4..., but the sequence stops with the first atari</div>
