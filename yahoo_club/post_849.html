    <div>Hello,<br><br>I have just reported to Yahoo! the following abuse:<br><br>Hello,<br><br>Mark Steere is defamating me by spreading lies in the group stacking-<br>games. I left this group because he and the owner of the group was <br>defending stereotypes and racist attitudes. <br><br>Steere now posted:<br>(http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking-games/message/180) <br><br>"I'd like to take a poll on how many people are relieved that Ralf is<br>gone. He had written a flattering article about me in Yahoo<br>abstractgames. Said article has now actually been removed, so I assume<br>that Ralf is moderator there as well."<br><br>Top Ten Reasons You Might Be a Nazi:<br><br>1. If you have an irresistable urge to snap your heels together . . .<br>you might be a Nazi."<br><br><br>The group to which he refers (abstractgames) is owned by Joao Neto. <br>Actually I wrote: "I admire Mark Steere (because of his wonderful <br>games.)" This was before I met him on stacking-games. When I got to <br>know his true character, I removed my message from abstract games.  <br>But there is still a response to my message which proves that I say <br>the truth: <br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/abstractgames/message/825<br><br>This is criminal conduct. If you don't remove Mark Steere from Yahoo!<br>Groups I will report his behavior to the police and also that Yahoo! <br>is tolerating criminal acts.<br><br>Sincerely, RJG<br><br>-----------------<br><br>Joao, I ask you you to help. Any way It's my birthday today.<br><br>Ralf</div>
