    <div>http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Mark_Steere_%28critical_views%29<br><br>I refuse lend any support to an individual who happens to throw me out<br>of his group stating that he "supports illegal activity", and also<br>threatened with a lawsuit (only reason is that I called you "Mr.<br>Herman").  You treat me as a hostile, AND use me to attack someone you<br>dislike?  That is GAUL.<br><br>You seriously need to grow up here.  There is a LOT more things more<br>important in life than this petty vindictiveness.  I want no part of<br>that.  You understand?  NO PART!</div>
