    <div>New game: Basic<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Basic_rules.pdf<br><br>Basic is an extremely simple game for the Checkers set.  It's easy to learn, easy to play, and easy to remember.  The design objective was to construct the largest possible game tree using Checkers equipment.  Basic was originally intended as a simple exercise just to stimulate the creative process.  I was surprised to find that this exercise was actually was a robust game in itself.  It only needed some trivial finishing touches.<br><br>I test played Basic several times in it's full form over the past couple of days and didn't uncover any problems.  On a 4x4 board with 4 checkers, perfect play results in a win for Player 2.  On a 4x6 wide board with 6 checkers, perfect play is a win for Player 1, I believe. The game tree is a little unwieldy at the increased board size.<br><br>Mirroring by Player 2 leads to a win for Player 1, assuming Player 1 were to even allow mirroring which would be easy to thwart.  So there's no incentive for Player 2 to mirror, which is very encouraging.  Mirroring is always a concern with the ultra symmetric Checkers set, having no center square.<br><br>How could such a simple rule set generate a substantial game tree?  Checkers equipment seems kind of minimal at first glance, compared to something as grandiose as the Go set, but it isn't.  A stack has number.  A stack has order.  That order can underlie vast expanses of game tree in a naturally finite game (no tiebreaker baloney) if you make efficient use of that order in the design.  E.g. no capturing.  Every time you remove a piece from the board, you hack off huge portions of the tree.  No multi-move, tree hacking turns, etc.<br><br>Is Basic free of flaws?  Not necessarily.  Its very simplicity is troublesome, but I resisted the temptation to add complications during design.  I'd rather just see it die than tamper with its marvelous simplicity.  <br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
