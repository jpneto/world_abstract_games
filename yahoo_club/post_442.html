    <div>Actually, lazo is a common word- in Spanish. It means "loop" <br>or "lasso" which is close enough for me.<br><br>No offense, Peter, but Loop is - ah - a bit geeky.<br>This is probably why it was a natural first choice for me.<br><br>I'm very interested in feedback about the rules page. Here is the URL <br>again: http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/lazo.html<br><br>Are the rules clear? Clear enough that you can find the correct move <br>in the six "puzzle" positions? With one exception, they are all <br>positions where a winning loop can be formed immediately.</div>
