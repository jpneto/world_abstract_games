    <div>>Drawing is just when neither player can win.  That's okay if, as<br>>mentioned previously, it takes some skill (or luck, in my case) to <br>>get to that point.  What's worse is if a player can indefinetly <br>>postpone the ending of the game (i.e. a winning player can never <br>>force a win or<br>>a draw).<br><br>To prevent that case in Chess there is another rule:<br>Either player can declare a draw if he can prove that 50 moves have <br>passed without a piece captured or a pawn moved.<br><br>-Robert</div>
