    <div>Oh, right.  Yeah, I removed the restriction that only a certain game<br>site could program Rush, I notified said game site that their<br>exclusive right to program Rush has been rescinded, and made an<br>Internet announcement.  We're good to go on Rush.  I look forward to<br>seeing your Rush program.<br><br>Rush should also be programmed for online play soon, person to person.<br> It's unfortunate that I kept Rush out of circulation for 9 months,<br>but I guess no good deed goes unpunished.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> >I'm sure I haven't made any changes since the original release.<br>> I could be wrong about that, but I meant the restriction about<br>programming <br>> the game, not the rules themselves.<br>> <br>></div>
