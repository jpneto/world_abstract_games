    <div>That, Rich, is a very good idea! I will try it on the Mrs next time we play (I'm teaching how/ testing my new game so she'll be glad of the break. I think Cribbage will be a good one to try.<br>   <br>  If you like backgammon go have a look at Gammot (type it in your tool bar or go to my site shinermonsgames.co.uk & look under Card & Dice Games)<br>   <br>  I'm sure you will get some purists who will bemoan such sacrilege but that is one of the best ideas ive heard in a long time - & it gives me an idea....<br>   <br>  Colin<br><br>Rich Hutnik <docreason@...> wrote:<br>          I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon<br>style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.<br><br>The idea:<br>1. Players play to an agreed number of points, or a set number of<br>games (the player with the most points at the end wins the match). <br>Unless stakes are raised, players get 1 point each if game ends in a<br>tie. Winner gets 2 points on a win, zero with a loss.<br>2. Points per game start at 2.<br>3. If player asks opponent to resign, and opponent agrees, then their<br>opponent resigns.<br>4. If opponent doesn't resign, then for game are doubled. The player<br>who raised the stakes must win the game, in order to get the full<br>amount of new points. If their opponent wins they game, then the<br>opponent gets a full amount of points. If game ends in a draw,<br>opponent gets half the amount of new points (this is done to encourage<br>players to play for win).<br>5. Redoubling is permitted. A player is only allowed to double or<br>redouble once, until their opponent agrees to redouble.<br><br><br><br>                         <br><br><br>Shinermons Games<br>  P.O.
