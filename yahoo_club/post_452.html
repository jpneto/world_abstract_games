    <div>> I have the first two on your list, Barrier and Crosse, and can get<br>> you the rules over the weekend.<br>> <br>> I'm also very interested in any information about the Aladdin line <br>> of abstracts; hadn't seen Courier before.  Other series I'd like <br>> to learn more about include the Ravensburger "travel games" (small <br>> square boxes) and the AbacusSpiele wooden games.  [...]<br><br>Basically I'm searching for games with one or two types of pieces for <br>each player (including stackable games) so that I may present them at <br>WAG. <br><br>Any game that you think fits the criteria, I would appreciate getting <br>a copy of the rules (by email, snail mail, scanner, ...). At least <br>those which explain the rules in one or two pages ;-)<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao</div>
