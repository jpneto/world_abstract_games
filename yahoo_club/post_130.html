    <div>I'm still waiting for a movie on Piet Hein, but<br>for now we have A Beautiful Mind. It tells the story<br>of John Nash, who independently "discovered" Hex (as<br>Hex players like to put it) in 1948 some six years<br>after Piet Hein. Hex is not mentioned in the movie but<br>Go comes up in a couple of scenes. The movie is more<br>about schizophrenia than math (or economics) but it<br>does a decent job illustrating Nash's equilibrium<br>theory. Nash has also been credited as co-inventor of a<br>pathological game called the "Dollar Auction." It's more like<br>a parlor trick and works as follows: Someone pulls<br>out a dollar and announces that he'll award it to the<br>high bidder, with the catch that the second highest<br>bidder loses his bid. Let's say you bid a penny. Someone<br>raises the bid to two pennies. Well, you may as well bid<br>up to three pennies, because you still stand to gain<br>97 cents. The game turns pathological when somebody<br>bids a dollar. The second high bidder, who, let's say,<br>is at 99 cents, may as well bid over to a dollar and<br>a penny. If he wins with that bid, he only loses a<br>penny, whereas if he fails to bid over, he loses 99<br>cents. In actual practice people commonly bid up to four<br>or five dollars using this logic, all for a dollar.</div>
