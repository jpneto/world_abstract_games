    <div>Some more playing tips:<br><br>Strings are easier to build along the edge of the playing field.  A <br>square field also offers the corners.  This is because placements <br>along this area gives your opponent limited responses and you can <br>more effectively "push" stones into needed positions.  Thus the <br>choice of a round or square field can effect the game.  I have not <br>seen any significant advantage of a hexagonal field over the simple <br>circular field.  But the triangular field offers some nice <br>possibilities, it just needs to be a bit large.<br><br>But don't forget the open area of the field.  Staking out territory <br>can be of great assistance during the game.  These stones can act as <br>barriers to your opponent's growing strings.<br><br>And don't be timid about sacrificing pieces to create these strings.  <br>Every string can strengthen your position in the game.<br><br>The basic tactic for initial string formation is to play a stone <br>adjacent an enemy, so that its capture will either place the opponent <br>stone adjacent another of yours or adjacent one of its own.  If <br>adjacent one of its own, you can capture them both using the 3-stone <br>loop formation as to leave your stone near enough another to <br>subsequently form a 3-stone string.  If adjacent on of your own, you <br>can capture in such a way as to leave space for a subsequent <br>placement making the 3-stone string.<br><br>You might try to create as many 3-stone strings as you are able at <br>the start of the game.  And anytime that space presents itself, you <br>might place a "seed".  Be aware of your opponent's attempt to also <br>claim such territory.<br><br>Forming completed strings, or loops, can prove quite difficult if <br>your opponent is aware of their possible occurence.   So don't count <br>on them but still create their potential to threaten your opponent <br>and choke off territory.  Just be careful, because you could lose the <br>entire string to one opponent stone.<br><br>"Safe" ends can be accomplished by merging two strings, or merging a <br>string with a "seed".  If you try to simply bring an end around on <br>itself, the opponent can place a stone at the final position and <br>effect a subsequent capture of the string.<br><br>You might use some form of material for the playing field, like light-<br>weight canvas or felt.  I have some nice green felt which always <br>comes in handy for various games.  This is because on a slick surface <br>the played stones might have a tendency to shift with only a slight <br>bump to the table.<br><br>The matchstick ruler has been a great aid in play.  Preventing many <br>arguments.  It is quite simple to make.</div>
