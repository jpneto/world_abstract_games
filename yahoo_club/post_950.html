    <div>Perhaps an addition. I talked to the guy who invented Strat-o-Sphere <br>while promoting another of his inventions at the Fair in Essen three <br>years ago and I said to him that I prefer the original game. Guess what <br>he said??? He said, yes, I do so to, but a larger board wouldn't sell <br>that well, so Gigamic decided to release only a small version. The <br>first time he came to Essen he had a huge board with really big balls <br>(I think Billiard balls) -- truly an eye-catcher, and Gigamic bought <br>the rights. Many game designers are so eager to find a publisher that <br>they compromize their own games. Kris Burm didn't want to do that, so <br>he was forced to start his own publishing company. <br><br>Ralph<br><br>> It's not a "plagiarism", it's a simplification so that it may sell <br>> better. But the quality of the game has suffered. Btw, you can buy <br>> white and black balls (at least in the Essen Game Fair) and even a <br>> board on which these balls fit, playing many interesting games not <br>just <br>> Stra-o-Sphere, but also Akron.</div>
