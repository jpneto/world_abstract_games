    <div>Hi all!<br><br>Sorry for this delay, I'm very<br>busy right now!<br><br>>The rules of this game are<br>exactly like regular Go, <br>>except for scoring the<br>game. At the end of the game, <br>>the only groups<br>of your stones which give you points <br>>are<br>those groups containing stones on the Life Wall,<br><br>>or whose territory contains intersections on the<br><br>>Life Wall. <br><br>3 days ago, I received Abstract<br>Games Magazine 5<br>and they present a new game called<br>Anchor where<br>a similar concept appear. The point, I<br>suppose<br>that applies also to your variant, is to keep<br>Go<br>and only change the life and death<br>concept.<br><br>Anchor is played on an 8 side hexagonal board, <br>and<br>there are 6 special points called anchors<br>3 for each<br>player, that have the power of life<br>at the end of the<br>game!<br><br>Am I wrong, or nowadays there is an<br>increasing<br>interest on Go variants?<br><br>Joao<br>Neto<br><br>[<a href=http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/magazine.html] target=new>http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/magazine.html]</a></div>
