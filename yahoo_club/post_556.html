    <div>> Each stone is consider to have exactly two <br>> liberites.  These liberties can take place <br>> anywhere along their circumferences.  Thus <br>> no stone will ever have more than two stones <br>> adjacent.  No stones on the field may be <br>> moved to place another, there must be sufficient <br>> space to make a placement.<br><br>I think you need to clarify just what these <br>"liberties" are. Does this mean simply that <br>a stone is allowed to touch no more than two <br>other stones, and if a chain of friendly stones<br>is sandwiched between two enemy stones it <br>is removed?<br><br>What if I have 6 stones whose centers are at the <br>corners of a regular hexagon about 1.1 diameters<br>on a side, leaving just enough room in the middle for an enemy stone, <br>but where the enemy stone could never connect with its allies, nor be <br>touched by two of my stones -- does that stone successfully <br>invade "my" territory? I suppose so, based on the rules you give, but <br>somehow it seems to me that it shouldn't.</div>
