    <div>Hi Chris,<br><br>Thanks for your post about 3 player games. This is a really interesting subject that does not have almost any contribution to it.<br><br>>The way to circumvent this is to eliminate the separate stages. <br>>Instead of the winner being the last player to reach the objective <br>>(staying in the game) the winner should be the first player to reach <br>>an objective. Moreover, to avert the formation of harmful alliances, <br>>each player's objective needs to be different but equal from the other <br>>players'.<br><br>Some years ago, me, Bill Taylor and Cameron Browne discussed about this same subject and we came up with several 3-player game extensions that tried to minimize the Petty Diplomacy problem. One of those mechanisms was to micro-compensate the player victim of a two-way alliance in order to make these alliances unstable ones.<br>One of those games is Triad (http://www.cameronius.com/games/triad/)<br>by Cam. <br><br>Those conversations were included in a chapter on the book "Mathematical Games, Abstract Games".<br><br>I'll check your games. And again, thanks!<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
