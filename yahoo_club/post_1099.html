    <div>The forum is now at:<br>http://www.abstractgamers.org<br><br>The petition is at:<br>http://petition.abstractgamers.org<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Abstract games have been given the short end of the stick in the table<br>> game arena.  I believe this should be dealt with.  As a result, I am<br>> looking to get an association started to promote abstract strategy<br>> games.  There is a petition you can "sign" on the Web to express your<br>> support, and a forum to discuss the idea.<br>> <br>> The forum is here on the Super Duper Games Site:<br>> http://forums.superdupergames.org/viewforum.php?f=3D14<br>> <br>> If you are interested in having one started, please sign the<br>> petition:<br>> http://www.petitiononline.com/asggroup/petition.html<br>> <br>> The name IAGO (International Abstract Games Organization) was proposed<br>> as a possible name by Bill Taylor on rec.games.abstract, and I happen<br>> to think that is a cool name myself.<br>> <br>> Anyhow, if you want to get involved, pleas sign the petition and visit<br>> the forum.<br>> <br>> Thank you for your time...<br>> - Richard<br>></div>
