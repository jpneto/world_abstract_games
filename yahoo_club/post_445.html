    <div>Area of interest... I haven't met a connection game I didn't like :-) <br>beginning with Go -- do you plan to mention Go in your book?<br><br>I have ended up reading about, and collecting a whole bunch of<br>abstracts, and designing a few -- a couple years back.  If you do a<br>search on groups.google.com for group:rec.games.* william-chang, and<br>sort-by-date (I just did, to my surprise there were lots of hits),<br>you'll see a "multidimensional taxonomy" scheme, as well as a few <br>designs: Cascades, Chinese Checkers Chess, RingGo (80% Go, 20% Hex), <br>Scorpio (nonadjacent-double-move Hex -- was this invented earlier??),<br>etc.  Google told me that ten years ago I had translated the official<br>XiangQi rules into English, and proposed a more rational notation --<br>I had completely forgotten about it.  <br><br>I only wish I had a regular playing partner, and copious spare time.<br>Seem to recall a "connection games" Yahoo Group being founded; is it<br>still around?  A regular chat & play session using Yahoo would be <br>real nice.<br><br>Best, -- William<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, ccaammbb <no_reply@y...> wrote:<br>> Hi William,<br>> <br>> Glad to hear that you're interested.
