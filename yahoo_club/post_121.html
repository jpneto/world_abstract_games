    <div>Hi<br><br>>I completed a beta this weekend of<br>Epaminondas, <br>>which may be a useful starting point for<br>Skalus <br>>or Kefren. <br><br>Yes, the winning goals<br>of all 3 games are very similar.<br><br>>Also, I<br>don't know whether it fits within the >definition of<br>Kings & Soldiers at your site, but >I have a nice<br>script of Camelot <br><br>yes, Camelot fits "Kings &<br>Soldiers" and I will include it someday this century :-)<br>When you have it, please send it to me!<br><br>>I<br>think Gonnect would be pretty hard to code<br><br>>mainly because Go and Hex just aren't the sort<br><br>>of games Zillions was designed to handle and I<br><br>>imagine the kludging that went into those <br>>scripts<br>would not combine well. <br><br>I'm certain that<br>Zillions will not be able to play Gonnect - but the ZRF<br>would be useful for netplaying between 2 human players.<br><br><br>In priciple, it would suffice to use the ZRF of GO,<br>and change the winning condition. There is no need<br>for prisioner or area counting. Just a<br>straightforward connection routine for orthogonal boards to check<br>winning games.<br><br>Cheers and happy Xmas for<br>all!!!<br><br>Joao</div>
