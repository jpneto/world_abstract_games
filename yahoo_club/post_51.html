    <div>>I'd like to hear from any of you who have<br>fixed a "flawed" game.<br><br>Well, I never fixed<br>commercial games, but I'm curious about your <br>fixings!<br>:)<br><br>>I consider regular 8x8 Othello to be flawed (larger<br>size boards <br>>are more interesting) because the<br>optimal strategy becomes obvious <br>>after playing<br>only a few games [..] I have a minor rule change<br><br>>which makes better use of the Othello pieces than<br>Othello <br>>itself does, and greatly improves the<br>game. <br><br>perhaps you can also post it for the 8x8<br>contest:<br><br>[<a href=http://boardgames.about.com/games/boardgames/library/weekly/aa102400a.htm] target=new>http://boardgames.about.com/games/boardgames/library/weekly/aa102400a.htm]</a><br><br>>Anyone care to guess before I post it? I'm wondering how<br>obvious <br>>my improvement is to<br>others.)<br><br>Hmmm... With such lack of clues it's hard! There is<br>MacBeth played<br>on a hex board and Desdemona with a 3rd<br>neutral piece type <br>(check Zillions site). Some<br>possibilities:<br><br>* Just use orthogonal flipping (or: Just use<br>diagonal flipping)<br>* Drop pieces anywhere (capturing is<br>not mandatory)<br>* May drop opponent pieces<br>*<br>Each piece may move (like a chess King) if that<br>produces a flip<br>* Rename it Iago ;-)<br><br>>Those<br>are the games I find difficult to analyze, so I'm<br>trying to <br>>stretch my brain by playing them more<br>often. <br><br>If you like Go type games, check Gonnect<br><br> <a href=http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/gonnect.html target=new>http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/gonnect.html</a></div>
