    <div>Hi Joao,<br><br><br>> (1) Except for the perfect player who would perfectly knows what is <br>> going on, a winning player would not start to "loose a bit", because <br>> it would risk his own victory, and,<br><br>Actually I had such a perfect player in mind. I have heard of a Go <br>story of a monk whose Go skill is so great that he always lost/win by <br>exactly one point no matter who he played, whether a beginner or <br>player of the greatest skill. <br><br>> (2) The loosing player would not go with that. After the future <br>> defeat is seen, the looser would try to loose as badly as he can <br>> (considering that the game is not a zero-sum game, and if it is, <br>this <br>> meta-rule makes no sense). Imagine Scrabble, the looser would start <br>> to make as few points as he can, trapping himself with lots of <br>> unusable letters.<br><br>Now that you mention it, I actually thought this might be what <br>happens. It very depend on the personallity of the person. For who <br>want to admit loss, even when it is imminent. <br><br>> Both players would play normally, until the victory-defeat horizon <br>is <br>> seen. After that, and taking these two points, the behaviour of the <br>> loosing player would fasten his own end, a kind of twisted min-max<br><br>I would think so. The winning player after seeing the end comming <br>would "help" the losing player not lose so much as long as it doesn't <br>risk his victory.<br><br>-Jianying Ji</div>
