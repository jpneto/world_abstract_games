    <div>Hello pduff!<br><br>This multi-Pente experience<br>with the same players must be<br>wonderful. I went<br>through something similar on a few (less<br>pure)<br>computer games played a hundred times over several years<br>with my<br>brother and one or two other friends and<br>computer opponents. I<br>then also tried multi-Pente a few<br>times and other interesting<br>abstract games -<br>multi-Hexbo is quite neat too. However I never<br>really<br>experienced players keeping a good mood, fine-tuning<br>their<br>style to others', evolving with each others, accepting<br>to loose<br>as much as each others and not getting<br>bored in the end. Aren't<br>you experiencing such a<br>dream? I wish I was there!<br><br>We cannot easily<br>compare Chess or any binary game with life any<br>longer<br>once we have had a taste of that new dimension! It's<br>like<br>the game isn't zero-sum anymore - your position<br>isn't<br>automatically better when your opponents' positions are<br>worse.<br>You must develop and share some kind of resources -<br>human<br>resources.<br><br>You probably know Mark Mammel, don't you? He wrote a<br>multi-Pente<br>program that behaves better than Zillions of games, using<br>one of<br>those simple ideas that takes time to<br>mature:<br><a href=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MMammel/marksfiv.htm target=new>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MMammel/marksfiv.htm</a><br>What do you think of its style?<br><br>My general<br>algorithm Joao mentions is<br>at:<br><a href=http://clauchau.free.fr/society.html target=new>http://clauchau.free.fr/society.html</a><br><br>I wanted to show it in action with multi-Pente but<br>never took the<br>time so far. It is just the standard<br>minmax algorithm with alpha-<br>beta pruning carefully<br>extended to more players. I don't think<br>there is any<br>other way to do that. As I saw it playing on<br>multi-<br>Hexxagon, it plays nicely, doesn't play solo at all, it<br>knows<br>that a part of its interests lies in others'<br>interests, thus it<br>cooperates very well without being<br>asked to and it plays perfect<br>endgames - almost,<br>Mark would say, because we slightly disagree<br>on how<br>to punish a player that blundered the game by<br>creating a<br>stupid dilemma.<br><br>In any case more is<br>needed with computer programs, because an<br>interesting<br>and good multi-player is a player who senses how<br>the<br>others are playing, who adapts, who makes his own style<br>clear<br>enough, and doesn't make too wrong assumptions about the<br>other<br>players' thinking depth...<br><br>By the way, good luck in<br>the final of the LoA tournament. I<br>haven't yet<br>recovered from the fact that you eliminated<br>me!<br><br>Claude Chaunier</div>
