It's extremely<br>> tacky to use another abstract games group to advertise your own<br>> abstract games group.

There's no emphasis whatsoever on abstract games,<br>> notwithstanding your bizarre attempts to redefine "abstract game".  So<br>> your presence here, at a legitimate abstract games group, goes beyond<br>> tacky.  You just don't belong.<br><br>Just because you are ticked off at IAGO now, due to a mess up in my<br>handling of the deletion of Ralf's message, you may want to consider<br>moving on, and doing other things with your time.  For the sake of<br>your own sanity, just drop it.  Just pretend IAGO doesn't exist and<br>move on.  You will have a lot more peace this way.  Of course, your<br>protests do a lot to show Ralf how much off he is. <br><br>Anyhow, best of luck to you Mark.</div>
