    <div>> I think a mutator would be a game rule that makes no reference to<br>> equipment specific to the game. For instance, the rule specifying how<br>> a Knight moves on a square-grid board has no applicability to a game<br>> where there are no Knights or in which the board is not square-grid.<br>> But the "double move" mutator could apply almost anywhere.<br><br>That's an interesting view. <br><br>The idea of abstraction should be - in a yet theoretical mutator<br>oriented programming language for abgames - linked with the idea of<br>composition so that each mutator, if it had a proper type, could be<br>composed with other mutators to easily form games and variants. A<br>programmer would just need to link mutators (and eventually create new<br>mutators) to implement a game.<br><br>This would be a different approach that Zillions uses, focusing on the<br>functional aspects and recycling of simple mutators/abstract game rules.<br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
