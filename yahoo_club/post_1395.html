    <div>Dear Peter,<br><br>> Announcing a new book for beginning go players:<br>> Beginning Go by Peter Shotwell and Susan Long<br>> Tuttle Publishing $14.95 159 pages<br><br>Thanks for the book information. Best of luck with the sales. Do you<br>know if it will be at Amazon's?<br> <br>> Peter Shotwell is an internationally known expert on the relationship <br>>of Go to Eastern and Western philosophy, literature, and history. He <br>>has been writing about go for more than twenty years and has lived in <br>>China, Tibet and Japan while researching the origins and background of <br>>the game. <br><br>Have you found, in your travels, any references to other traditional<br>abstract games played on those countries? And do you know and have<br>details at the game of Fang (which means, I think, Square) played in<br>some regions of China?<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
