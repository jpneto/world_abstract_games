    <div>Cool. seems "the way of go" is the name that is<br>liked by everyone here.<br><br>Actually, it is no<br>coincidence at all that my game have similarity to Line of<br>Action by Claude Soucie. It and its cousin, field of<br>action by sid sackson, is some of the more important<br>influences on me when I created this game. The following<br>would be a good diagram of the connections between the<br>various games that led to my game.<br><br>Line of<br>Action->Field of Action<br>Field of Action+Renju(Pie<br>rule)->The Way<br>The Way+Go->The Way of Go<br><br>Thanks<br>for the URL. I emailed Kerry Handscomb<br>and got the<br>rules of the competition from him. I think I will<br>definitely try to enter it soon.<br><br>Thanks</div>
