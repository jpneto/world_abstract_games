    <div>Hi Joao,<br> <br>> In Board Draughts stones also cannot capture and just move and jump <br>> forward, and the goal is to move all stones to the last row (where <br>> they are removed from board). Wins the player with no stones left. <br><br>Is the initial position as in Draughts and jumping compulsory?<br><br>> Contract Checkers, is an variant invented in Chicago, 1934, played <br>> like 8x8 Draughts, but each player has 2 more stones offboard, that <br>> can be dropped on an empty cell on the first row, when the<br>respective <br>> cell on the last row is also empty.<br><br>I know the variant from German game books written by ex-director of<br>Ravensburg Glonnegger (and dead now). Your description appears to be<br>the first complete one, I come across. Thank you.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
