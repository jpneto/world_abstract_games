    <div>Hi,<br>I mentioned Quarti, my finger exercise in Connect-N games. Here are the<br>rules:<br><br>===<br><br>Quarti is an abstract game played on a standard 19x19 Go board. There is a<br>sufficient amount of white and black pieces for each of the 2 players.<br><br>Players in turn place 1 piece of their color on the intersections of the<br>lines on the board. White begins.<br><br>After the first move each player must place their piece orthogonally<br>connected to another piece.<br><br>Connected pieces of the same color are called a "group" (n.b.: a group isn't<br>necessarily a *straight* line of pieces).<br><br>It is not allowed to create a group of (exactly) 4 pieces.<br><br>To win a game of Quarti, a player must create a group of 5 (or more) pieces.<br><br>===<br><br>That's it. It works, but I don't feel totally confident about it. Maybe<br>there is something deep inside.<br><br>Have fun!<br><br>  Dieter</div>
