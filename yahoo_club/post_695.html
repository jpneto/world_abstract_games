    <div>I would think then that is the complexity, and ease of the draw that <br>is the factor.  In tic-tac-toe for example, the human mind can <br>easily draw that game indefinitely, kinda like in the <br>movie 'Wargames'.  However in Chess, even the highest level <br>computers yet, and humans playing for a draw can not sucessfully <br>achieve it in every case.  I don't know the game Halma, but I would <br>agree if all it takes is to move a piece back and forth to draw, <br>that there is a problem with the rules.  If there was a tournament <br>against a grand master Halma player, I could get a 1/2 point, and <br>yet never have played the game.  However in chess if all you did was <br>move your knight around, you'd be busted as soon as you got to the <br>middle game.  Maybe part of the rules for Halma should be to make it <br>a loss to move a piece back and forth 3 times. (sorta similiar to if <br>both players had done so in chess to make it a draw).<br><br>-Robert</div>
