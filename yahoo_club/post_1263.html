There *are* a lot to choose from, aren't there! :-D<br>I'd start off slow; pick a dozen or so, and try to make them totally<br>independent, not interacting with each other in bizarre ways. The<br>advantage to this is that it's doable, and can easily be made at least<br>playtestable. Real easy would be to let each player pick 4 of 12 total<br>mutators. <br>You'd want them very general. For example, Fluid subsumes Amazonia<br>with the right rules subset, and is more general - suppose there are<br>no queens in the game? <br>Another more general way that acts more like your enchantment would be<br>Add A [short range] Move: add to any piece the move of a wazir, or<br>ferz, or dababbah, or alfil, or knight. <br>Fluid's opposite is Frozen [obvious how it works], Add A Move's is<br>Subtract A Move. If you wanted to combine them, you could call them<br>Stacking? and Change A Move, giving 2 very, very general mutators that<br>don't. really.. interact..., or do they? <br>At this level of generality, you can at least add one knight to and<br>stack one knight with any friendly piece, including a knight. This has<br>to give at least a 3-step knightrider, something not found in either<br>Fluid or Add A [Knight] Move alone. <br>Convert/Drop is a nice mutator that is general and doesn't interact,<br>as far as I can see - but we're only up to 3 mutators now. <br>Grow is 4, another non-interacting mutator.<br><br>We've hit our first crisis here. Why? Because these are 4 easy and<br>decent mutators, and I'd like to use them, but I gotta ask just how do<br>we apply them? Can I grow the board every turn? Or only once? If, when<br>I grow the board, I have used up that mutator for me, can I pick it<br>for all 4 of my mutator picks, and grow the board 4 times? Does my<br>picking it keep my opponent from picking it, or not? How about I can<br>use it any and every turn I want? Then what happens to knightriders? A<br>thorny problem that could grow a Rose [Rose: a circular knightrider]. <br><br>Enough for this post.</div>
