    <div>Daniel Schultz discovered a flaw in Cage.  There were no legal moves available in the following scenario: A ring of 8 stones around the center, arranged red, blue, red, blue...<br><br>I relaxed the rule constraints a tad to allow for a legal move in that situation.  See Figure 5.<br><br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br><br>Daniel played the Cage program about 50 times before this special position occurred to him, so it wasn't real obvious.  I don't see how any problems could exist in Cage now but that's how I felt about the original version.  So, stay tuned I guess  lol<br><br>The new version allows a new type of move but it doesn't disallow any old move types, so it's a superset of the old version.  There's a larger tree and there should be a correspondingly richer gameplay. <br><br>Yeah it's a little embarrassing when flaws turn up, but at least a fan discovered it and broke it to me gently.  I didn't have to learn about it from the usual YIPPEE I PROVED MARK STEERE WRONG!! public announcement.  <br><br>Bottom line, an outstanding game just became a little more outstanding.  I took the downloadable Cage program off my website for now, but hopefully Thomas Plick will agree to incorporate the change into his program.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com<br>=</div>
