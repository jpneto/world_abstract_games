    <div>Congrats on the online debut of Abande.  SDG is a great site, and <br>Aaron is definitely one of the good guys.  He's programmed Byte, and <br>Impasse so far.  Can't think of anything bad to say about Aaron.<br><br>Anyway, back to Abande.  Looks like an interesting game, and I look <br>forward to playing.  I've already accepted your challenge on SDG.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Dieter Stein <dieter@s...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> I am very pleased to announce the debut of the online version of <br>the <br>> stacking/connection game Abande.
