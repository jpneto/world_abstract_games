    <div>Using your definitions, I cannot see how the "one piece per turn move<br>sequence" would be a so-called second order rule.  I would consider<br>this one of the most basic concepts of game playing.  I would state<br>that games that have a rule permitting more than "one piece per turn<br>move sequence" would be utilizing a second order rule.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, joao_neto_1970 <no_reply@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Not all rules of a game are equal. Some define the essence of the game<br>> (like the existence of a royal piece in chess), others are just<br>> adaptations in search of better dynamics and subtler positions (like<br>> the queen's move range).<br>> <br>> Even in abstract games, I tend to favor very short rules,<br>> acknowledging the fact that some fixing may be needed to create a<br>> proper rule set. I prefer games that focus on one sort of interaction<br>> instead of several ones and exploit it elegant ways. Using this<br>> criterion, Hex should be the most simple and deep game there is.

Rules like these, if well<br>> chosen, are a good pathway to create a fine abstract game (but, at<br>> this moment, starts a new business: make all those rules interact<br>> properly which is much more difficult than joining some unrelated good<br>> ideas in the same pot).

The concept of royal<br>> piece and capture by replacement would be first-order.<br>> <br>> Cheers, <br>> <br>> Jo=E3o Pedro Neto<br>><br><br><br><br><br>=</div>
