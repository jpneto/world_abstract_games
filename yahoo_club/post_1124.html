    <div>But what's wrong with competition? Should no one do anything that<br>doesn't attract both sexes in equal numbers? Quite a few arts would be<br>lost in that case -- knitting, cooking, and lacemaking, to name just a<br>few, as well as abstract games. I don't see it as problematic if men<br>and women don't have equal inclination to join a voluntary organization.<br><br>Mark<br><br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Steven Meyers" <swmeyers@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> Looking over the current list of signatures, I couldn't help but <br>> notice that all 27 signers appear to be men.
