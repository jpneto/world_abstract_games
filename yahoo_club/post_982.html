    <div>How do we spell games?<br><br>What is your opinon?<br><br>Ralf<br><br>The following discussion is still going on at the Wikimanqala:<br><br><br>Talk:Progressive Mancala<br>From Wikimanqala<br><br>Sorry about the lowercases. In phpwiki all links had to be CamelCase,<br>so I didn't know if ProgressiveMancala was normal English (progressive<br>mancala) or something else. As you have seen, on German names I've<br>tried (when I've realized) to keep the uppercase (Bohnenspiel and so<br>on). Don't hesitate, of course, to rename anything wrong. Any way, at<br>least in Catalan (and in English but there are more uppercases) I<br>don't like to write "jugo a escacs, go, dames, aual=C3=A9 i Progressive<br>Mancala." It looks weird: hundreds of years old well known games<br>written in lowercase and a newcomer in uppercase... :-) --WikiSysop<br>13:43, 19 August 2006 (CEST)<br><br>We need to have a discussion one day about whether games should or<br>could be capitalized. You know I have written numerous articles for<br>the Canadian Abstract Games magazine and the editors decided to write<br>all games (including all old ones) with upper cases. They even had a<br>discussion about it in the "letters to the editor" section. I doubt<br>that there are many go books, rather they are Go books. Sackson wrote<br>all games in upper cases. So he could distinguish Cups (=3Dgame) from<br>cups (=3Dholes in the game of Cups). But obviously it's possible to<br>spell games in English as you do. In German, it looks terribly odd -<br>so if you permit to use the German (original) spelling of my games,<br>that would be a great favour. --Mancala lover 19:44, 19 August 2006 (CEST)<br><br>    I'll have to find it and read the discussion. But, anyway, in<br>English is as wrong writing Bulgarian Solitaire as is writing<br>bulgarian solitaire. Bulgarian must be uppercase and solitaire<br>lowercase. At least, it is so according to what I know about<br>ortotypography (or what I've found now on the net, as [1], [2], [3],<br>[4]...). --WikiSysop 21:27, 19 August 2006 (CEST) <br><br>        The bibliography written by an American professor has<br>following spellings: <br><br>    * Bulgarian Solitaire 5-times<br>    * Bulgarian solitaire 3-times <br><br>Just conduct an internet search of Bulgarian Solitaire and you will<br>find that both spellings are fairly common among native speakers and<br>in English journals. --Mancala lover 09:04, 20 August 2006 (CEST)</div>
