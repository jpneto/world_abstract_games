In other <br>> words, it is a bad game.<br>> <br>> Jo=E3o<br><br>Let's take the example of the player in a game of Halma who on his <br>turn all he does is shift the same piece back and forth.  He is able <br>to force the game into a draw very quickly and easily.  But this <br>person isn't *playing* the game at all.  They are, in effect, <br>refusing to play.  Why did they even bother to sit down to a game if <br>this is all they are going to do?  It's like the analogy of the man <br>in the boxing match who just runs away from his opponent.  The real <br>question is if he didn't want to fight, why did he step into the <br>ring in the first place?<br><br>Someone brought up Chess tournaments, and that a player will go for <br>a draw in a match against an opponent he doesn't expect to win <br>against.  But this still can be considered playing to win.  A <br>tournament consists of a series of games, just as a game consists of <br>a series of moves.  Deliberately going for a draw in one game is <br>part of an overall strategy to increase their scoring in the <br>tournament.<br><br>It is important to recognize that any game that can end in a draw <br>will end in a draw if that's a player's sole intent and purpose. <br><br>I think we need to distinguish between games that are drawable (i.e. <br>games that are capable of ending in a draw) and games that are <br>drawish (i.e. games that during the normal course of play, with both <br>sides playing to win, still tend to end in a draw).<br><br>A great number of abstract games are drawable.  And I don't think <br>one could completely remove the conditions that allow a particular <br>game to end in a draw without changing the fundamental nature of the <br>game itself.  Take Chess, for example.  Its rules have been evolving <br>over the course of centuries and it has been the subject of <br>countless experimentation.  Yet draws still remain an important <br>element of the game.<br><br>Checkers is a good example of a drawish game in that draws are <br>frequent between well matched players.  <br><br>However, simply because draws are a factor in a game doesn't mean <br>the rules are flawed and the game is bad.  Look at the three games <br>we've mentioned:  Chess, Checkers and Halma.  These are universally <br>considered some of the greatest abstract games around.  Just because <br>they contain an element of draws, no one should considered them <br>broken.  Rather we should say they are not perfect.  But what game <br>is?  Even Go has its shortcomings.<br><br>IMHO, its a matter of degrees.  Checkers is a drawish game, yet <br>still enough matches end in a win or loss to keep the game <br>interesting.  On the other hand the L-Game is so completely drawish <br>that I would consider it a broken game.  Even with both sides <br>playing to win, the game tends to continue on indefinitely.</div>
