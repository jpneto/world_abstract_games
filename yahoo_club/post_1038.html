    <div>The following is excerpted from a post in the yahoo group mancala-<br>games, where alternative points of view are not tolerated.  The <br>original article was stolen from a Super Duper Games forum, where <br>Ralf is not tolerated.<br><br>>Misconceptions on mancala games abound in Europe and the USA.<br><br>>(1)<br>>"Mancala games are primitive in a cultural sense as well as a<br>>mathematical sense."<br><br>>Obviously the writer has never heard of never-ending moves in <br>Omweso,<br>>the number Pi in Ayo and the complex game theoretical values found <br>in<br>>Atomic Wari. <br><br>Nothing you've stated refutes the primitiveness of traditional <br>Mancala games. <br><br>>He also never seems to have heard of the rich mythodology<br>>and the complex social functions associated with our games.<br><br>Is mythodology related in any way to strategery?</div>
