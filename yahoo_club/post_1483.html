    <div>Hi Greg,<br><br>It's just the quality of Scott's programming, i.e. the user interface.<br> Looking at the GamesByEmail Dipole program for example, every<br>opportunity for innovation has been seized.  Everything that can be<br>optimized has been optimized.  Let me run through a few items.<br><br>1. The board colors are muted and the pieces are large, bright, and<br>clearly labeled.  Great start.<br>2. You click on a stack and drag a translucent piece around.  When it<br>approaches a legal square, it snaps to center, becomes opaque, and<br>displays the stack size.   *And* simultaneously the original stack<br>size is adjusted.  All this before releasing the mouse button.  Nobody<br>else has that. <br><br>3. Moving a stack off the board - more innovation.  You move the stack<br>to a square just outside the board and "+" and "-" buttons appear so<br>you can adjust the number of pieces you want to move off.  Again,<br>nobody else has that.  All the other Dipole programs give you a list<br>of stack sizes to select from.  Scott's technique significantly<br>reduces the amount of screen real estate required, as well as the<br>distance you have to move the mouse.<br><br>4. The artfulness.  While the board and pieces are almost completely<br>two dimensional appearing, Scott put some texture and shading onto the<br>pieces in a way that doesn't impair the clarity or visibility of the<br>board or pieces.<br><br>5. Etc., etc., etc.<br><br>It's the level of quality.  You return to your room at at the Naples<br>Ritz-Carlton after an awesome dining experience at their restaurant,<br>and the bed is turned down with a mint on the pillow.  Every minute<br>detail has been attended to.<br><br>No offense to you or others who have programmed my games.  I<br>appreciate all the good work done.  It's just that Scott deserves<br>kudos for advancing the state of the art, or to put it another way,<br>elevated the quality of the user interface to new heights.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Hi Mark,<br>> <br>> I'd be interested in knowing more about your comment.
