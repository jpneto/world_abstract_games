    <div>I just had an idea for a novel connection game. Think of the squares<br>on a grid as being connected orthogonally and also in one of the<br>diagonal directions but not the other, so the grid is topologically<br>equivalent to a board of hexagons. Now consider three such squares<br>arranged with each one perpendicular to the other two, on the sides of<br>a cube (I think of them as the bottom, rear left, and rear right of a<br>cube, where I'm looking toward one edge of the cube).<br><br>If the square grids are, say, 10x10, then there are 1000 cells in the<br>cube. Let two players alternately choose cells in the cube, cells that<br>are not in any orthogonal line with any previously-chosen cell, and<br>mark the squares corresponding to that cell on all three grids in the<br>player's color. In this way the players play three simultaneous games<br>of Hex, and whichever one wins two or more of them wins the game. Note<br>that this is not equivalent to playing three games on separate,<br>standard boards, because your move on any one board restricts your<br>possible moves on the other two, and your moves on two boards<br>completely determine your move on the third.<br><br>What would be nice would be to redefine this general idea somehow so<br>that a move that captures the center on any one board would not be so<br>powerful on the other two. A thought: consider one of the three boards<br>(the one at the base, perhaps) as wrapping around toroidally, and make<br>the edges that are supposed to be connected go through what looks like<br>the center of that face. Then the centers of the other two boards<br>correspond to edges of this board, and they aren't so powerful. <br><br>Then one could also say that instead of playing stones of your own<br>color on all three boards, you have to play one stone of the<br>opponent's color on one of the two vertical boards. So you could make<br>a good move for yourself on the North board, but the West board would<br>have to be a move for your opponent, and the Bottom board would be a<br>not-so-great move for you. I'm not sure this would work as I'm hoping,<br>but perhaps some other way of varying the idea would do it.</div>
