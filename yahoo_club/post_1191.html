    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Larry Wheeler" <br>> <br>> Mark, "abstract game" is just a phrase in ordinary English, and has no<br>> technical meaning for the vast majority of the world's population.<br><br>This isn't the vast majority of the world's population.  This is an<br>abstract games discussion forum.<br> <br>> The fact there there is so much dispute over the finer points of the<br>> definition just points up the need for a defining document.<br><br>Maybe so.  But that defining document isn't going to take the form of<br>a list of of the wall, subjective requirements and include retarded<br>statements like "Note, at this present time, a game can be accepted<br>into IAGO, as a non-standard abstract if it deviates from, at most,<br>one of the above factors." <br><br><br>> A second point: If a game is not a theoretical draw, then <br>> there has to be an advantage for one player or the other <br>> (obvious). There are several potential problems here: how do <br>> you decide when one player has too much of an advantage to <br>> allow the game to be admitted, and do you remove the game <br>> from the list if the game is solved/known/believed to<br>> give one player a winning advantage?<br>><br><br>No game is perfect.  There will be a move order advantage and it will<br>be a function of skill level.  When is a game not a game?  Don't know.<br> Good question, but there's no objective way to answer that.<br>=</div>
