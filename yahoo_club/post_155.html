    <div>I have Crosse, Kage, and Ergo in my collection,  but I think they're <br>in my storage shed, several miles away.  Next time I get out there <br>I'll hunt for them.<br><br>Of the three, Ergo looked most promising, in my opinion.  I'm pretty <br>sure Crosse had a random element, like dice.  Kage involved confining <br>("caging", hence the name) an opposing piece, slightly like Amazons <br>(or Trap), but I didn't think it had as much potential subtlety as <br>Amazons.  I don't remember the details of Ergo, but I think it was a <br>little more complex.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br>Chicago, IL</div>
