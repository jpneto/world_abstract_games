    <div>> By consistantly insisting that abstract <br>> games conform to pre-defined conditions, this will stifle creativity <br>> and eventually lead to stagnation.<br><br><br>Would you please stop to torture us with this pseudo-intellectual<br>nonsense! <br><br><br>> There are many developers who wish that their games will be <br>> recognized as the epitome of its genre.  Often they attempt to <br>> achieve this by completely eliminating others from such<br>competition.  <br>> The easy process is to define them out of the running.<br><br>Again, please start to use your brain (if you have one). I am not a<br>game developper. Your imputations would be impudent even if I would be<br>one. <br>Perhaps you're paranoid and believe that everybody has evil<br>intentions. <br><br>Your rhetorics are disgusting and a shame to you.<br><br>Everybody is free to invent and promote the games s/he likes. This has<br>nothing to do with the definition of terms. A game needs not to be<br>called "abstract" to be "successful"!<br><br>An abstract game is basically a game solely decided by logical<br>thinking, not by by speed, not by chance, not by manual dexterity, not<br>by psychology ("coalitions"), just by skill. If you call this a better<br>game is solely up to moralists like you. <br><br>TruthForum</div>
