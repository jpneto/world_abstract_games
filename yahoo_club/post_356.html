    <div>>    "Stones may block each others.

(Often as "lead", "point to"). My translation is:<br><br>"Stones may block each others. From blockade is only one way - namely, capturing a weaker stone."<br><br>I am not Czech, but I am living in Prague. Can I help with translation of another game ?<br><br>Richard</div>
