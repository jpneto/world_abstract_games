(That is, if Player 1 were<br>> first to choose.  Otherwise it would be game number 481.)  Basically<br>> it'd be a game of Nim followed by game number 480.  Really not a bad<br>> idea as this would serve to minimize move order advantage.  But, then<br>> again, perfect play would lead to a draw.<br><br>Hmmm. Well, certainly perfect play in a game so close to chess would<br>pretty likely end in a draw. The notion of ranking the games according<br>to favorableness to Player 1 is a little iffy, since (assuming perfect<br>play) all possible variants would have values of either +1, 0, or -1<br>to player 1, and hence there would probably be something like a<br>700-way tie for 480th place.<br><br>But in normal, imperfect play, players would consider certain variants<br>as more or less favorable depending on their own expertise with them,<br>their perception of their opponent's expertise with them, their<br>perception of their opponent's perception of their own expertise with<br>them, etc. Hence, 480th place would in practice be even more<br>subjective ...<br><br>Mark</div>
