    <div>The reason for the rules are as follows.<br><br>I<br>want this game be mostly positional. That is the<br>placement of the pieces have great effect on the game. Thus<br>the rules about movement.<br><br>Also because of<br>above, I also wanted the game enphasis on placement, so<br>I decided to restrict movement to absolutely<br>necessary, so the rule that movement allowed when pieces are<br>threatened.<br><br>There is however downsides to these rules which is why<br>I try to balance it. For example. isolated pieces<br>becomes very vulnerable, so I made them invulnerable.<br>This counterbalance however might make the game to<br>'rigid', ie. not enough movement allowed, so I should have<br>also ammended that isolated pieces can be 'threatened'<br>(though not captured)<br><br>The reason for the<br>restriction on placement is to have the game focused in the<br>beginning and keep the opening manageable and more or less<br>independent of board size.<br><br>You are absolutely right<br>that I need more sample games, however at this time I<br>haven't entirely tested everything out. And needs<br>playtesters to help in generating sample games. Hopefully<br>some of the people here can help.<br><br>Thank you.</div>
