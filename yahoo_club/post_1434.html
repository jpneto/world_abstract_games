    <div>Have you read "Maelzel's Chess Player"?  It' essentially Poe's take on <br>game AI.  He places a chess playing automaton in a class far above <br>Babbage's calculating machine since the latter can make decisions based <br>upon the possibilites it encounters as opposed to following a fixed <br>sequence of calculation such as that required to produce astronomical and <br>navigation tables.  Surprisingly, as sophisticated as Poe was, he was <br>fooled into believing the Turk was truly an automaton.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br><br><br><br>ccaammbb <no_reply@yahoogroups.com> <br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>04/29/2008 05:03 PM<br>Please respond to<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br>To<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>cc<br><br>Subject<br>[Abstract Games] Edgar Allan Poe: Combinatorial game theorist<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hi,<br><br>I recently read "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" by Edgar Alan Poe and <br>was amazed that he begins the story with a bit of combinatorial game <br>analysis. He writes: "In this latter [Chess], where the pieces have <br>different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what <br>is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is <br>profound."<br><br>Poe goes on to say: "In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves <br>are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of <br>inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left <br>comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either <br>party are obtained by superior acumen." <br><br>In other words, he's saying that Draughts has greater clarity than <br>Chess, allowing players to concentrate more on strategic analysis <br>than on the trivial bookkeeping of working out which moves are legal <br>or not. This story was written in 1841(!!!) so the concept of clarity <br>has been around for at least 167 years, even if it has only recently <br>been given a name.<br><br>Later in the story Poe writes: "Truth is not always in a well. In <br>fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she <br>is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we <br>seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found." With a <br>little imagination this can be extrapolated to refer to depth in <br>games; the good moves all stare us in the face, but it is the amount <br>of effort required to work out which is the best move (i.e. the <br>amount of time spent exploring the valleys of suboptimal play) that <br>indicates the depth of a game.<br><br>Cameron<br><br> <br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
