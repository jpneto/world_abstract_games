    <div>Hi Clark,<br><br>> Joao, I think a section on Mancala games would be a great addition <br>>to WAG.<br><br>That crossed my mind :) I read somewhere that there are 200+ mancalas <br>but most of them are very similar (am I wrong?) with just very little <br>rules changes. I wonder how many "really different" mancala variants <br>are there? (I'm trying to buy a good mancala book, but they are <br>unavailable at Amazon...)<br><br>btw, I'm making a webpage "The Mancala Family" as I did to checkers <br>and moku games, and will post it at Games of Towers. I just included <br>3 variants and placed a lot of links. You (and everybody else :^) can <br>check it at the provisory link: <br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/_T_mancala.htm (I will remove the _T_ <br>when I post it). Comments are also welcome.<br><br>Joao</div>
