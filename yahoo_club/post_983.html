    <div>Hello all,<br><br>I am pleased to announce the beginning of a new podcast: Abstract <br>Gamer.<br><br>In this podcast, I will discuss... wait for it... Games! With a <br>focus on abstract strategy games. (Bet you didn't see that coming, <br>did you?) OK, I'm sure you did.  ;)  I expect new episodes to be <br>published every couple weeks.<br><br>In the current episode (Episode 2) I introduce myself again, discuss <br>the Shogi family of games, and go into details about Chu Shogi. I'm <br>still finding my voice, but I have fixed some of the technical <br>issues from the previous episode. Thanks to all who gave me feedback <br>on that episode.<br><br>Episode 3 will be about handicaps, the GIPF project and GIPF in <br>detail. I'm in post production and expect to release it next week.<br><br>I hope you enjoy the show. Feel free to contact me at <br>abstractgamer@... with any comments, or leave a comment on the <br>blog (http://www.abstractgamer.com)<br><br>-JEEP</div>
