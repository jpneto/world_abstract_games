    <div>Hello,<br><br>if you are interested in stacking games, come and our group<br>stacking_games:<br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking_games/<br><br>The group should not be confused with the other group mentioned by<br>Mark which is for all practical purposes dead as it basically serves<br>as an ego-booster for Mark and to slander me.  <br><br>The fact is simply that Mark used the old group to spread racist<br>stereotypes which was supported by Walter and eventually destroyed it<br>as most of its messages are now in no way related to stacking games. <br><br>Ralf</div>
