    <div>There are various French and German pages that refer to the game (on-line<br>game stores, Essen reports, etc.)  that can be found through Google, and by<br>using the Google translator it's possible to see some descriptions of the<br>game in English. I haven't found a complete rule set however. What I have<br>found agrees with TruthForum's description. There is also apparently a rule<br>that gives a player an additional free move after he moves a pyramid onto a<br>dark space. The pyramids are equalateral and 3-sided just like a D4 die, and<br>are moved by tumbling them onto one of their three visible faces, landing on<br>one of the adjacent triangular spaces. <br> <br>-Mike Schoessow<br> <br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: truthforum2001 [mailto:Peace_Panther@...]<br>Sent: Tuesday, September 10, 2002 6:41 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] rules of Sahara<br><br><br><br>Hello,<br><br><br>> Do you have the rules for Sahara? Can you give a summary of them?<br><br>Not easy. I played it about half a year ago: <br><br>At the beginning the pieces are in pairs at the corners of the board, <br>on the left side "white" on the right side is "black". <br><br>Photo:<br>http://www.toysinternational.cc/images/Sahara.jpg<br><http://www.toysinternational.cc/images/Sahara.jpg> <br><br>The pieces are pyramides which are moving by rotating to an adjacent <br>triangular "square" of either color. Pieces cannot rotate over <br>another piece. A piece is captured when all sides are bordered by the <br>edge of the board and/or another piece of either color. The first <br>player to capture a piece wins the game (as in "The Game of Susan"). <br><br>TruthForum<br>  <br><br><br><br>Yahoo!
