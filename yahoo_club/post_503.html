    <div>Post your incoherent drivel on a site where someone might care.  This <br>is an abstract games board, not a politics board.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf Gering" <br><Peace_Panther@h...> wrote:<br>> <br>> So, it's insulting? Let me add some more oil to your fire.  Many <br>people are <br>> very happy about every British or American aggressor who is killed <br>in Iraq. <br>> Didn't Jesus say: " for all who take the sword will perish by the <br>sword."  <br>> Iraq seems to be a fullfilling prophecy whether you like it or not. <br>America <br>> has turned into a rogue state, the most dangerous threat for world <br>peace. <br>> And Guantanamo Bay is nothing else than a modern concentration<br>camp. <br>The <br>> majority of the American population is as deceived today as the <br>Germans were <br>> when they frantically shouted (in 1944?): "We want the total war!" <br>The <br>> Germans got what they deserved.
