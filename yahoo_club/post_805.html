    <div>Ralf, clarity is not in direct correlation with the number of changed <br>stones. At some NIM games, a lot of stones are removed but usually <br>these games have good clarity. On the other hand, games with little <br>changed stones per turn can have very bad clarity. Just this week, <br>Larry Wheeler told me about his game Cellf (check at Zillions site) <br>which is a nice original idea but the game is very hard to follow. <br>However, the game just changes one stone at a time.<br><br>I don't think it's just a problem of my part (and of Cam's): LOA is <br>hard to follow. If there is just one or two changed stones, many other <br>stones change their move range, since move is a parameter of the board <br>position. Folding that in two or three moves in the future, and even <br>tactical plans become blurry.<br><br>Oc, clarity is a qualitative measure. People that never saw chess <br>would say it has the clarity of Ultima (another game with bad clarity) <br>even if for, say, a chess master, the classic game is a wide open <br>landscape.<br><br>Anyway, what games do you think are better examples for the concept?<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
