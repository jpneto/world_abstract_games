However,<br>there is distinct risks of things breaking down.  I believe there very<br>much would need to be handled the way Magic:The Gathering is handled<br>and the mutators are playtested together.<br><br>I also believe that the following should be done with them:<br>1. All potential mutators that can come into play are exposed before<br>the game starts.  This is not Magic where you suddenly break out<br>something you don't expect.<br>2. Players alternate turns picking which mutator they want to possible<br>use during the game.<br>3. Players are each given a certain amount they can bring into play. <br>These mutators will have a value for them potentially.<br>4. There can be a nullify mutator which causes a mutator in play to go<br>out of play.<br>5. A mutator acts as a global enchantment in Magic and affects both<br>players equally.<br>6. For balance purposes, mutators are determined to be brought into<br>play before or after a player's turn, depending on when it is brought<br>it aids their opponent more.  If a mutator causes an opponent to get<br>an edge after your turn, that is when it comes into effect.  If it is<br>advantageous to them for it to be played before you do your turn, that<br>is when it comes into effect.<br>7. Mutators are by class, or type, and there can be restrictions on<br>how pieces move.<br>8. To start out, a mutator could merely be rules that are from other<br>games.  If you were doing chess, for example, you can have a Shogi<br>mutator which allows you to cause an enemy piece to convert to your<br>side.  You can also have an Amazonia power which turns a queen into an<br> Amazon.<br><br>Actually what was said about mutators ended up being changed a bit by<br>me to be something that would be like an enchantment in Magic, rather<br>than a very generic rule.</div>
