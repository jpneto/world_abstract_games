    <div>:D<br><br>Here is a description of me that Ralf posted on this group on Nov. 11,<br>2005, message 821 which has since been deleted.  <br><br>"I admire Mark Steere. He is one of the most brilliant people who ever<br>lived on our planet. He invented Impasse and Tanbo. Tanbo is like a<br>game from another universe, absolutely fascinating. Now he has created<br>Byte:<br><br>http://www.bytegame.com/<br><br>Try it!<br><br>Ralf" <br><br>I can't imagine how, in Ralf's mind, his initial description of me on<br>this group correlates with his article on that Wikipedia wannabe site<br>trashing me and Tanbo.  How did someone get that old and still be such<br>an infant?  He probably stuffed his mother like Norman Bates.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>><br>> http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Mark_Steere_%28critical_views%29<br>> <br>> I refuse lend any support to an individual who happens to throw me out<br>> of his group stating that he "supports illegal activity", and also<br>> threatened with a lawsuit (only reason is that I called you "Mr.<br>> Herman").  You treat me as a hostile, AND use me to attack someone you<br>> dislike?  That is GAUL.<br>> <br>> You seriously need to grow up here.  There is a LOT more things more<br>> important in life than this petty vindictiveness.  I want no part of<br>> that.  You understand?  NO PART!<br>></div>
