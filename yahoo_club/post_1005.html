    <div>The rules for the seventh public game design contest for the piecepack<br><http://www.piecepack.org> have been announced, and the theme is Good<br>Portsmanship. In the spirit of free and open source software and<br>culture, every entry must be a translation, or "port", of an existing<br>game to the piecepack. While this may seem like a mechanical exercise<br>at first glance, there is plenty of room for the game designer's<br>talents.<br><br>There was some debate on the piecepack mailing list about the original<br>rules of the contest, which some people thought were rather strict.<br>There have been several easements, and the rules are now at version 2.<br>They can be found here:<br><br>http://www.ludism.org/piecepack/pp7.html<br><br>Deadline for submissions is 3 December 2006, so you still have plenty<br>of time to enter.<br><br>Please forward this message to any other mailing lists, forums,<br>newsgroups, or friends you think are appropriate.<br><br>Share and Enjoy,<br><br>Ron Hale-Evans, Port Authority<br><br>-- <br>    Ron Hale-Evans ... rwhe@... ... http://ron.ludism.org/<br>Mind Performance Hacks book: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mindperfhks/<br>	   Center for Ludic Synergy: http://www.ludism.org/<br>(revilous life proving aye the death of ronaldses when winpower wine has<br>		   bucked the kick on poor won man)</div>
