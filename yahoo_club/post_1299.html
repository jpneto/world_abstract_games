    <div>Again I advise not to reply to Mark. He as a mentally disturbed person<br>has lost any touch with reality. I didn't ask Aaron to ban Steere,<br>just to take action. In fact, Steere told Aaron in a SDG forum to<br>remove me and my games. And the original stacking games group was<br>destroyed by Mark Steere as he is now destroying this group.<br><br>Below a response by Aaron:<br>(Note: I forwarded to him Mark's mail "You've announced ...")<br><br>Re: FW: You've announced your departure five times already . . .‚Äè<br>From: 	Aaron Dalton (aaron@daltons.ca)<br>Sent: 	Friday, November 17, 2006 7:46:47 PM<br>To: 	Ralf Gering (peace_panther@...)<br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA1<br> <br>Ralf Gering wrote:<br>> Please, don't write nonsense, Aaron.

You are making me regret<br>having ever considered implementing your games and welcoming you into my<br>home.  I have been nothing but kind, patient, and even-handed and you<br>persist in your insults.  On one hand you say you want reconciliation,<br>but on the other you show me no respect whatever.  If you want to play<br>or discuss games, my INBOX is open to you; otherwise, stay out if it.  I<br>have enough stress in my life.

I think what<br>> you're alluding to here is that you were publicly demanding that Aaron<br>> expel me from SDG.  As a result of your continued public, screaming,<br>> hysterical, foaming at the mouth demands that I be kicked out, *you*<br>> got kicked out.  This following an extended period of Aaron trying to<br>> peaceably reason with you, extending you the olive branch again and<br>> again, only to have you grab the branch and hit him over the head with<br>> it.  Finally, having exhausted all other options, he finally fired<br>> you.  Nobody other than you has ever been banned from SDG.  You hold<br>> the uncontested title as the most obnoxious member ever.  (Imagine<br>that.)<br>> <br>> By the way this is the exact same thing that happened at the original<br>> stacking-games group. (You know?  The one that you copied?)  The very<br>> day I joined that group I saw a series of posts by you where you were<br>> alternately commanding and pleading with the owner to expel me, and I<br>> HADN'T EVEN JOINED YET!  In one particularly touching post you said it<br>> was your birthday and as a present to you, the owner should ban me. <br>> (Twilight zone music here.)<br>> <br>> See a pattern here Hermann?<br>></div>
