    <div>I've received a number of compliments about Tether and I've had to inform the well wishers individually that Tether has fallen prey to the law that my most interesting game concepts are also the most vulnerable to flaws.  The problem with Tether was that there might be no capturing and both players might not succeed at cordoning off space for themselves.  In that case Player 1 wins automatically.  Or if it's a pseudo tie with each player cordoning off three spaces for himself, for example, same result.<br><br>Looking back it should have been obvious, but sometimes designers get carried away and this happened here.  I did play test it for a few days but apparently not enough. <br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
