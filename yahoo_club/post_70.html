    <div>Hi!<br>I am a new member of this club.<br> I can<br>value the beauty of games like go or chess but they are<br>quite studied already. Now, my favourites games are LoA<br>(Lines of Action) and connection games and now I am<br>looking for a new wild game to tame (domesticate) it. Any<br>idea?<br>As you will be able to fell, I do not speak english<br>very well (my language is spanish. If you understand<br>it, please, let me know). Sometimes you will have to<br>be very patient.<br>I am very interested in<br>something I call 'Methodology of Abstract Games' (or how to<br>study Abstract Games) (not how to discover and develop<br>strategies and so on but its esence, genetical evolution<br>-from other games and imagination too- common<br>properties between them ... <br>I am still looking for a<br>convincing definition of 'An Abstract Game'. What is the<br>current one?<br><br>- Jorge Gï¿½mez Arrausi.</div>
