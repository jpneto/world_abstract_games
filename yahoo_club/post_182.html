    <div>> > It's arguable that the term abstract game could also <br>> > include "themeless" strategy games like Backgammon<br>> <br>> There's nothing more "themeless" in backgammon than, say, in go.<br><br>When I say "themeless" I mean it doesn't have, for instance, a theme <br>of settling an undeveloped island, as Settlers of Catan does, or a <br>theme of operating a fleet of pirate ships, as Pirateer does, or <br>building a chain of hotels, as Acquire does. A "theme" can have <br>either a lot to do with the underlying game, or very little. Games <br>that are strongly-themed tend to have complicated rules, while games <br>with little or no theme to them are much more elegant. I would say <br>that both Go and Backgammon are themeless, and I would say it with <br>approval.<br><br>There's a new game called Siesta, where the pieces are "suns, roofs, <br>and shadows" and getting a line of three in the right order scores <br>points. This would be an example of a game with a very weak theme: as <br>far as I can see the only point in calling the pieces by those names <br>and giving them the appearance they have is to make it easy for the <br>players to remember in what order they must appear to score points. <br>Chess is another weakly-themed game, where the theme only shows up in <br>the names of the pieces, which dimly suggests their importance and <br>strategic roles.<br><br>Anyway, though "abstract game" is a term used by mathematicians for a <br>two-player, finite (meaning it must eventually end), perfect <br>information game, the sense of the word "abstract" could also make a <br>person think of simply, a game with no theme. Since so many games are <br>abstract in both senses (like Othello, Pente, Go, Hex, etc.), it's <br>not always clear which usage is intended. Probably there should be <br>two terms -- anyone want to propose a new one?</div>
