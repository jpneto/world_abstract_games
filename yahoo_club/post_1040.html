    <div>Misconceptions on mancala games abound in Europe and the USA.<br><br>(1)<br>"Mancala games are primitive in a cultural sense as well as a<br>mathematical sense."<br><br>Obviously the writer has never heard of never-ending moves in Omweso,<br>the number Pi in Ayo and the complex game theoretical values found in<br>Atomic Wari. He also never seems to have heard of the rich mythodology<br>and the complex social functions associated with our games. As the<br>game playing equipment of many traditional games is "primitive", it is<br>concluded that the cultural and mathematical content of mancala games<br>must also be "primitive". This viewpoint is racist (and as most racism<br>based on ignorance) - and still very common.<br><br>Furthermore, this statement totally neglects modern developments in<br>the mancala family of games which introduced differentiated counters<br>(Glass Bead Game, Pyramidis, Space Walk, Cirk, Hackaback, Banan-Cala,<br>Martian Mancala, Octagon, Rondell, Geisterfahrer, Coin Duel, Kariba,<br>... - btw, differentiated counters already existed in Yunnan, China),<br>stacking and two-dimensional sowing. We only know that the old<br>definition of mancala games does no longer work, but we don't know yet<br>how a modern definition of mancala should look like.<br><br><br>(2)<br>"There are two limiting factors in Mancala sets. One is that it's<br>played in very poor countries where the only workable material you<br>might have available would be dung. And so you could only manufacture<br>one color of stones."<br><br>Even if only very few materials are available (as stone, wood and<br>shells), you can make games such as Go or Bao. Western people still<br>see (subconciously or openly) Chess as the ultimate mindsport, a game<br>with complex playing pieces. So, games with rather simple equipment<br>as, for instance, Draughts, Morris and mancala games are considered by<br>many as being "children's games". This eurocentric view is (when<br>related to African or Asian games) neo-colonialist, imperialist and<br>racist. It's the way how Europeans (and Americans) looked down on<br>foreign cultures in the 19th century, but it still persists among<br>those in America and Europe who are less educated. Games as Chess<br>served to reproduce and legitimate hierarchies within western<br>societies, but also globally.<br><br><br>(3)<br>"A limiting factor is the minimum practical cup size. Generally<br>speaking, you'll need about 2-1/2" inch spacing between cup centers,<br>and a board which is at least 1-1/4" tall, in order to allow for cups<br>which are big enough to hold a decent number of stones and which you<br>can scoop your hand into. So given those size contstraints (sic!), an<br>8x8 grid would require a 20"x20"x1-1/4" board. Pretty voluminous and<br>expensive. A 19x19 grid, given the same size contstraints (sic!, would<br>require a 4'x4'x1-1/4" board. Definitely not practical."<br><br>In this eurocentric view the constraints of western capitalism are<br>used to define what is "practical" or not. In Africa, large boards are<br>often communally owned and kept in communal meeting places. So these<br>mancala games are as practical as expensive billiard tables that are<br>kept in pubs. Other large boards are simply dug into the ground which<br>appear to pastoral people to be much more practical than our<br>preoccupation of having solid boards made of wood.<br><br><br>(4)<br>"The unlimited number of stones per cup makes gameplay *too* complex.<br>Not only is gameplay overly complex, but you can't actually see the<br>number of stones in a large pile."<br><br>The writer confuses the limited abilities he has as a beginner with<br>what is possible in gameplay if a game is played for a long time. This<br>is an egocentric view. An advanced player may easily handle cups which<br>contain a large number of seeds. A master player also doesn't need to<br>count the contents of a hole, he knows it. In Toguz kumalak the seeds<br>form easily recognizable patterns so that even beginners can see at a<br>glance how many seeds a hole contains.<br><br>(5)<br>"Illustrating the complexity afforded by unlimited stones per cup,<br>here is the readout of *one move* in 55Stones:<br>^ ^ ^ Blue seeded to J, picked up the 2 pieces still in that cup, and<br>is ready to continue. ^ ^ Blue seeded to H, picked up the 3 pieces<br>still in that cup, and is ready to continue. ^ Red seeds (...)"<br><br>The writer is confusing the relative complexity of multiple lap games<br>with the number of seeds a hole contains. The result of multiple lap<br>games can be hard or even impossible to predict for humans. Games as<br>Omweso and Bao show, however, that these games can be "mastered" (ie.<br>can be played on a very high level) and that experienced Bao players<br>can look many steps ahead (see de Voogt's Duru experiment). So, there<br>is no reason to believe that 55Stones couldn't be mastered as well.<br><br>Ralf<br><br><br>[Note: the quotes are marked as such, so nothing was "stolen".]</div>
