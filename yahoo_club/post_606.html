    <div>I have invented a game that you might be interested in.  It is <br>currently unpublished.  It meets all of your criteria (except perhaps <br>resistance to programming, about which I have my doubts for any <br>game), has simple equipment requirements, and is playable on a wide <br>range of board sizes.  If you want to discuss it with me, send me an <br>email.</div>
