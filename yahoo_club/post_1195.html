    <div>> Do we have the rules codified somewhere, or was it just discussed in<br>> the thread on Fischer's Random Chess?<br><br>Just in message 1167 of this forum. I thought of it moments before I<br>posted that message, and named it by tongue-in-cheek analogy with FRC.<br><br>I suppose the best way to play it would be something like this: have a<br>"deck" of the 960 opening setups, and have each player separate the<br>deck into at least 2 and no more than N piles, each pile containing no<br>fewer than 1/K of the remaining cards in the deck. (Tournament<br>director will specify the values of N and K beforehand. K would have<br>to be greater than N.) If the pile chosen contains more than one card,<br>the player repeats this step. The other player inspects the piles and<br>chooses one of them. If the pile chosen contains only one card, that<br>setup is used for the game, and the player who chose it plays Black. <br><br>I'd guess (only a guess) 5 and 10 would be suitable values for N and K.<br><br>The concept of each player placing one piece in the back row for both<br>sides until everything is populated according to the Chess960<br>constraints is probably a simpler and clearer way of doing this,<br>though TNRC would be "freer".<br><br>Mark</div>
