    <div>> I just think it's a different phase, since DVONN pieces are special <br>> ones. But the rules doesn't change on this point<br><br>In the second phase (officially numbered) you move all kinds of <br>different pieces (different composition, different heights), and yet <br>you call it just one phase. BTW I simply follow the official <br>nomenclature.<br><br>> No it isn't! The sentence, as mark pointed, is a recursive <br>> definition which is correct. I teach Functional Programming, <br>> so there is some professional bias on this :-)<br><br>It might be mathematically correct, but it sounds awfully <br>circumstantial for non-mathematicians. Don't you want to write the <br>rules in a way that avarage people would be able to understand it? Or <br>do you write for functional programmers? That's not meant to attack <br>you personally, Joao, I very much appreciate your work.<br><br>truthforum</div>
