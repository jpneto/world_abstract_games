    <div>> Hello Mark.  I am assuming you are the same person who wrote for Games<br>> Journal and wrote the Defining the Abstract article in 2000.  If so, I<br>> would like to have you give input here, and give a seal of approval<br>> for what would qualify as acceptable abstracts for tournament<br>> structure. <br><br>Yep, that's me. But I don't have a seal and am probably too<br>libertarian to pronounce on acceptability. I would say you should just<br>set up your tournament however you please.<br><br>> I have tried to encompass as much as your article into a<br>> definition of a Standard IAGO abstract, plus add more criterion, and<br>> would like your seal of approval on it (since someone on here pretty<br>> much said I am clueless in knowing what an abstract strategy game is).<br><br>Gee! I'm gratified you liked my article. I actually only wrote it<br>(years and years ago) as a piece of fluff for my website, a "fanny<br>piece" we used to call it back in my high school journalism days. Not<br>sure I can handle that much responsibility ... <br><br>> I am at a situation where I want the organization to function, and not<br>> fly apart by going down a path where it morphs into a general<br>> boardgame association. <br><br>I've never known how to get people to do something, such as<br>participate in an organization. The most I would know how to do is<br>offer an activity and hope for the best, which is why I recommend you<br>organize the tournament to please yourself and don't worry what anyone<br>else thinks of it. If people come, good; if they don't, do something else.<br><br>> But also, need to look at pragmatic situations<br>> like considering representing Chess960, eventhough it isn't a<br>> Combinatorial Game Theorist approved abstract strategy game (because<br>> people are playing it).<br><br>So I'd say, offer Chess960 if you like, or don't if you'd rather not.<br>If you want to offer Chess960 but are concerned that it's not an<br>abstract game in the mathematical sense, change the name of your<br>tournament to something that would include it. Or if you'd like to use<br>"Thompson Nonrandom Chess", you're certainly welcome to do that ...<br><br>Mark</div>
