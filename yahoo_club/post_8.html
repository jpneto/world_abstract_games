    <div>[thanks for the URL, mark!]<br><br>I read<br>yesterday that an ELO difference of 100 represents a 0.69<br>winning ration between players, so at every 100 games, a<br>2000 ELO player wins approx. 69 against a 1900 ELO<br>player, and so on...<br><br>The same seems to happen,<br>approx. to a step in Go grades (1st Kyu vs 1st Dan, and<br>so on...)<br><br>Is it a coincidence that 0.69 is so<br>close to 2/3 = 0.67? Or there is something more on<br>these numbers?<br>Any ideas?<br><br>Joao</div>
