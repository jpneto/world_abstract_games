    <div>Another twist on "Knight Pente".<br><br>If I recall correctly, the original message about the<br>topic, on this yahoogroup, was posted a few days ago<br>by someone using the address "Markthomps". (My<br>apologies to the real author, if I misremembered.)<br><br>Markthomps said, basically, that the _Move_ was<br>restricted to Knight moves, but the _Goal_ (i.e. the<br>definition of how to win the game) remained the same<br>(i.e. you get five-in-a-row _not_ using knight moves).<br><br>I suddenly notice you could create yet another<br>interesting variant by taking the reverse of what<br>Markthomps said. In other words, say that the player<br>can move anywhere he wants, as in Orthodox Pente, but<br>the five-in-a-row that creates a win must be arranged<br>along Knight moves. In other words, if you had stones<br>on a1, b3, c5, d7, e9, that would be a win.<br><br>Niankhaset.<br><br>----Jo�o wrote in abstractgames 2005-12-05:<br>> > The idea is simple.
