    <div>I'm confused by the apparrent concern that chess is going to be "solved". <br>Chess is in no danger of being "solved".  Maybe this is due to the recent <br>publicity concerning Schaeffer's work with checkers.<br>You don't need to take my word for it, just do a little reading on the <br>subject.<br><br>For example, from Chessbase.com:<br><br>"if a computer could solve checkers completely in one nanosecond (a single <br>cycle of a 1 GHz computer), it would take this computer 3000 years to <br>solve chess"<br><br>-- Greg<br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
