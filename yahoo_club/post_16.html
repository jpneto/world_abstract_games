    <div>Hi<br><br>When people have an idea for a abstract<br>board game, what should she or he must worry<br>about?<br><br>In the last mensage about SCALUS, there were a<br>question about drawish strategies. A game inventor must<br>always worry about it, in order to avoid creating a dead<br>game.<br><br>What are other rules that help avoid those common<br>traps in game making? Some are:<br><br>* Check 1st<br>player advantage. If it seems to great, and there is no<br>elegant way to prevent it, introduce 1-move or 3-move<br>equalizers<br><br>* Keep drawish strategies out of the game. Usually,<br>capturing rules or a odd board with a center cell or<br>square, prevent this.<br><br>* Avoid too many draws at<br>endgame.<br><br>* Avoid too powerful or too weak pieces, unless<br>that can be balanced in other ways.<br><br>[other<br>ideas?]<br><br>joao</div>
