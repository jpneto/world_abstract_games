    <div>> could you correct the the following mistakes:<br><br>Thanks for the comments. I didn't noticed the fact that men can jump <br>backwards in International Checkers and a lot of noise propagated <br>from that. I tried to correct those problems.<br><br>About your remarks between Spanish and Pool checkers: the <br>differences do not change the nature of the game. They are only <br>rotational and color change diferences, right? <br><br>Jo=E3o Neto</div>
