    <div>A fantastic game site<br><br>http://www.vanmaanen.org/hans/boeken/wolf/wolf.html<br><br>Try Avanti!  It's a very interesting game. If you win by getting your <br>treasure to your goal you get two points, if your blockade your opponent, <br>you win by one point.<br><br><br>> > Most Europeans don't like aggressors.<br>> > [snip]<br>><br>>gratuitously insulting.<br><br>And a final comment:<br><br>So, it's insulting? Let me add some more oil to your fire.  Many people are <br>very happy about every British or American aggressor who is killed in Iraq. <br>Didn't Jesus say: " for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."  <br>Iraq seems to be a fullfilling prophecy whether you like it or not. America <br>has turned into a rogue state, the most dangerous threat for world peace. <br>And Guantanamo Bay is nothing else than a modern concentration camp. The <br>majority of the American population is as deceived today as the Germans were <br>when they frantically shouted (in 1944?): "We want the total war!" The <br>Germans got what they deserved. Didn't Jesus say: "You will harvest what you <br>sow!" Jesus was a wise man and every tongue should praise his wisdom.<br><br>It's weird. Actually the members of this forum who play abstract wars should <br>know that in *every* war you need to know how to end a battle *before* you <br>start one. Oxford University Press once published a book named "The <br>Protracted Game" - in which scholars were comparing WeiQi (Go) strategy to <br>the strategy of the Maoist People's Army. The Iraqi resistance movement is <br>doing nothing else now than playing a game of Weiqi with the aggressors. And <br>from a Biblical point of view Islam may have become the rod of a blasphemous <br>pseudo-Christian government in quite the same manner as Anabaptists <br>perceived the Turks in the 16th century.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>5 neue Buddies = 50 FreeSMS. http://messenger-mania.msn.de Messenger-Mania - <br>FreeSMS abrï¿½umen mit dem MSN Messenger!</div>
