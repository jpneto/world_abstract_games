    <div>Hi Ralf,<br><br>Thanks for your questions regarding my classification of connection <br>games. It's good to see someone actually take this on board and <br>challenge it. I'll try to address the points you raise.<br><br>>1. Troll is considered a connection game by Browne, <br>>while Gomullo is not.<br><br>The aim of Troll is to connect both sides of the board; this is <br>clearly a game with a strictly connective goal. <br><br>The aim of Gomullo is to form a pattern of N pieces in a row; this <br>is a pattern-based goal and not strictly a connection-based one. <br>Also, Gomullo involves the flipping of pieces surrounded in a line <br>(again, a pattern) so it does not really involve connective play <br>either.<br><br>>2. Go is considered a connection game, while Amazons <br>>(Juego de las Amazonas) and Guerilla is not.<br><br>Amazons is a very interesting case! I thought hard about this one <br>before excluding it from the Connective Play > Territorial category, <br>and my reasons are as follows: piece movements and arrow movements <br>are line-of-sight. While this obviously implies the connection of <br>empty board points that form paths, these paths *must* be straight, <br>hence they are pattern-based rather than truly connection-based. A <br>truly connection-based Amazons would let the pieces and arrows move <br>to *any connected empty point* not just line-of-sight points. <br><br>However, Amazons is a great game and one that I would like to cover <br>in more detail in future. Perhaps it could be used as an <br>illustrative example of the difference between connection-based <br>moves and pattern-based ones.<br><br>>The borders between territorial games and connection <br>>games appear to be shifted in Browne's Taxonomy so <br>>that sometimes rather odd classifications emerge.<br><br>Possibly true. What I've tried to do is lump together in the <br>Connective Play > Territorial section those connection games that <br>tend to have a territorial flavour; this does not imply a given <br>territorial game is a connection game.<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron</div>
