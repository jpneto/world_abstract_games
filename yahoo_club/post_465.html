    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, I wrote<br>> ... BeeLine is another connection game<br>> where each piece is made up of three hexes (two of one color!) that<br>> I would like to try at some point, when I have more time.<br><br>I got this "Sackson Collection" game via eBay.  Here are the rules,<br>my paraphrase:<br><br>Beeline, 1984 John Brasell, Christchurch NZ<br><br>board: order-9 hexagonal (216 hexes)<br><br>tiles: 24 of each of the following (ignore the leading dots)<br>..o     x<br>.x x   o o<br><br>first move: Black chooses an unplayed tile and places it anywhere <br>within the board.<br><br>subsequent moves: Each player alternately places a new tile, touching <br>an existing tile edgewise.<br><br>object: To connect opposite sides (each corner belongs to two sides), <br>or three alternating sides, or surround at least two opponent hexes <br>(doesn't say who wins if a tile achieves this goal for both sides at <br>the same time).<br><br>draw: If tiles run out.<br><br>attractive, good production values: Glossy board, graduated orange<br>shading towards center; felt-backed cardboard tiles; slipcase cover.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>I can think of two other games that use a similar "organic growth"<br>mechanism: Zenix by Gigamic, and my little toy game called Cascades.<br><br>Zenix, my paraphrase: Think of Connect4 on a triangular board with<br>eight cells at the base (or half of a hex board); 3 colors -- one <br>neutral -- of 12 pieces each; object is to form the _longest_ simple <br>chain of your color.  Very attractive stacking hexagonal sticks;<br>I bought three sets on sale to play order-14 Zenix :-)<br><br>Cascades: Kind of a double-move Zenix with starting position xoxo..., <br>played on a widening trapezoidal board (down, instead of up), whose <br>object is to capture the most cells at the farthest row (bottom).<br><br>Now, I wrote all that to set up this question:<br><br>Has anyone considered a Hex variant whose object is to form the<br>longest simple (non-self-intersecting) chain?  (I realize Maxi-Star<br>(R Wayne Schmittberger's variant of Ea Ea's Star) bears a certain<br>resemblance...)<br><br>Which brings up another question:<br><br>I have heard/read _about_ Schmittberger's June 2000 article on<br>connection games in Games Magazine -- alas I've never come across<br>a copy.  Does it have any information that's not available on the <br>web, or can someone perhaps make a copy for me?<br><br>-- William Chang (Saratoga CA)</div>
