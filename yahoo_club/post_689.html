    <div>Ever been to chess tournaments?  Such as ones with some really high <br>class players?  The strategy in many cases against higher rated <br>players is infact to force the game into a draw.  A draw in fact in <br>tournament chess gives you a half point.  So they are not <br>necessarily always playing for the win.  It is definitely not a rule <br>of conduct.<br><br>I find games such as that can be boring as obviously the player <br>against 'Data' was concerned.  Higher rated chess players that do <br>play to win, try to find opening lines that can yield difficult <br>death defying board situations that do not yield a draw.  However <br>this more agressive play can be hazerdous.  I have watched some of <br>these Grand Master matches, and they will declare a draw, when the <br>game just started.  Because they realize that the game is about to <br>decend into boring useless play, that will finally yield a draw in <br>the end anyway, in ways that my simpler mind cannot fathom.  Or <br>maybe they are satisfied with the half point.<br><br>-Robert</div>
