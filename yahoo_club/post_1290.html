    <div>Steere is the main sponsor of Super Duper Games, donating a total of<br>at least $ 3,000 (as of July 2007), while $ 245 were paid by other<br>people and $ 350 by anonymous donators (it appears that Steere was one<br>among them). As he contributed more than 83%, he has an enormous<br>influence on Super Duper Games (SDG). Steere bombarded me with nasty<br>emails after my games were implemented demanding that I should leave<br>SDG. I forwarded these harrassing emails to the "owner" of SDG (Aaron<br>Dalton) and requested to protect me. He couldn't because he would have<br>to close SDG without Steere's money and instead decided to remove me.<br><br>And, indeed, many on this forum have not the slightest idea about what<br>is going on.<br><br>> The whole problem leading to Herr Hermann's banishment from SDG was a<br>> result of Herr Hermann's extreme arrogance combined with his poor<br>> understanding of the English language.  You can see the arrogance in<br>> his original post here to Joe.  His initial comment to Joe was "You<br>> know nothing."  No "Hi".  No "How are you?".  Just "You know nothing."</div>
