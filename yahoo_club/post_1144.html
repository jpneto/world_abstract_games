    <div>Think of this as an olympics for mental competition.<br><br>The American Go Association (http://www.usgo.org) put this up on their<br>website, after Bridge had been indicating it is on. Think of this as<br>an Olympics for mental competition.  The news:<br><br>1ST INT'L MIND SPORTS GAMES SET FOR `O8 IN CHINA: (9/30/2007) The<br>First International Mind Sport Games will be held in Beijing in<br>October, 2008, reports Roy Laird, Chairman of the AGA Board of<br>Directors. Calling it "An Olympics for mental competition," Laird<br>tells the EJ that "The concept became a reality on September 26, when<br>International Mind Sports Association (IMSA) President Jose Damiani<br>announced that the four IMSA members (Go, Bridge, Chess, Draughts),<br>along with Xiang-Qi  (Chinese Chess), will hold the first ever World<br>Mind Sports Games (WMSG) from October 3 through 18, 2008 in Beijing,"<br>which will have just hosted the Olympic games a few weeks before. This<br>will be the first such international mind sport competition under<br>General Association of International Sports Federation (GAISF) <br>auspices. "GAISF works closely with the Olympics movement, but don't<br>expect to see go being played between ice skating and gymnastics on<br>Wide World of Sports," says Laird. "Instead, a parallel set of<br>competitions is evolving, through the recently formed International<br>Mind Sports Association." It is expected that more than 2,500 players<br>from over 100 countries will compete in 25 to 30 medal events in the<br>WMSG. In addition to individual events, team and pair competitions<br>will be also be held. "Through the International Mind Sport Games,<br>more people will become aware of the value and joy of mental<br>competition," says Laird, who promises that "American players will be<br>there! But we're going to need your help. The American Go Foundation<br>is seeking sponsors who would like to support the 2008 US go team with<br>a tax-deductible donation. Your employer might also appreciate the<br>opportunity to support such a historic event."</div>
