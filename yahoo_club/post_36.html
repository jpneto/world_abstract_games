I would rather write 2x3 when the 3 is<br>not obvious. I would also write x3 and x for x/3 and<br>the whole stone x respectively. Now when it is<br>clearly stated that every fraction is a multiple of 3, I<br>hesitate between<br><br>- banning any number, as I did in<br>my diagram above. We would write xx, x, and xxx for<br>2x/3, x/3, and x respectively;<br><br>- leaving any 3<br>out. We would write 2x, 1x, and x for 2x/3, x/3, and x<br>respectively;<br><br>- using the kind of decimal point Joao suggests -<br>but writing down the 2, not the 3. We would write x2,<br>x1, and 1x for (0 + 2/3)x, (0 + 1/3)x, and (1 + 0/3)x<br>respectively;<br><br>Claude Chaunier</div>
