    <div>Joe,<br><br>you understand nothing. Mark is (as Rich told you) a well-known<br>"troll". He wrote an article for the English Wikipedia, declaring<br>himself to be the greatest game inventor ever, after which he was<br>"diagnosed" to have some sort of mental illness by Wikipedians. He was<br>called "dishonest, incompetent, and fanatical" and "Mister Textual<br>Analysis". It was then recommended to him to look up "psychological<br>projection" and (...) "narcissism":<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3DWikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_3&diff=3D62522110&oldid=3D62400796<br><br>I am receiving harassing e-mails from Mark Steere with criminal<br>content for years.<br><br>He has also insulted Dieter Stein, the inventor of Abande <br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking-games/message/183<br>- and also people on rec.games.abstract.<br><br>I recommend to you what you have asked Rich to do: Don't reply for 24<br>hours and use this time to inform yourself about Mark Steere.<br><br>Ralf</div>
