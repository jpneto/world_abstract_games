    <div>Hi TruthForum,<br><br>Yes, Orbit lends itself pretty well to variants.  I've designed 29 myself.  Many of them are not very good, but several of them are.<br><br>Chinese Orbit (if I've understood the rules correctly) most closely resembles the "orbits capture and prohibit, half-orbits capture and prohibit, quarter-orbits capture and prohibit" variant.  There are two differences:  1.  The scoring is Chinese-style rather than (almost) Japanese-style.  2.  In Chinese Orbit, it is permitted to play inside an opponent's structure if at the same time you are completing your own structure.  The second difference is of course more significant.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: truthforum2001 <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 3:29 PM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Chinese Orbit (a variant of standard orbit)<br><br><br><br>  Hi Steve,<br><br>  I think, I've now understood your standard rules. Many "non-standard" <br>  variants are possible. I would like to call the following one the <br>  Chinese variant because it bears resemblance to the Weiqi rules of Go:<br><br>  "Chinese Orbit" is played on a board with 15x15 points. <br><br>  An "orbit" is a chain of stones of one color (diagonally or <br>  orthogonally adjacent) which is either connected to itself or to one <br>  edge or to two adjacent edges of the board, encircling empty points <br>  and/or opponent's stones. <br><br>  After an "orbit" is formed any opponent's stones inside of it are <br>  removed.<br><br>  It is not permitted to play inside an opponent's orbit unless <br>  an "orbit" is formed in the same move.<br><br>  It is not permitted to repeat a board position in a Ko fight.<br><br>  "Territory" is counted as follows: your own points inside your orbits <br>  plus the number of your stones on the board at the end of the game. <br>  The sum of all points equals the numbers of board points. "Seki" <br>  (local stalemate) or drawn games are impossible.<br><br><br>  TruthForum<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        Yahoo!
