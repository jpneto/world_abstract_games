    <div>I will look to calm down. I am in no mood to get into heated arguments<br>with anyone.  As far as I am concerned, IAGO needs to make as many<br>friends as it can here.  There is a lot at stake.  I ask everyone (and<br>demand of myself also) civility and patience.  Please realize that<br>IAGO isn't going to be perfectly what everyone wants.  I would like to<br>see a lot of groaning acceptance though, out of necessity of what<br>needs to be done.<br><br>What I will say is I look to have 2 player combinatorial game theory<br>games at the core and the "gravity point" things are supposed to head<br>towards.  These games are more likely to get accepted into the<br>International Mind Sports games for one thing.<br><br>As I see it, practical reality does call for acceptance of Chess960,<br>Dark Chess and even Backgammon.  Even the case of where IAGO may end<br>up getting involved in a chess-poker hybrid tournament (or even a<br>poker-backgammon tournament).  IAGO isn't looking to be a poker<br>association, but if getting IAGO on TV explaining what it stands for<br>and represents and so on, needs to be done, it needs to be done.<br><br>I am asking people to please be civil (including myself) and also<br>realize that more harm will come to IAGO if things are done wrong,<br>that ever can happen to abstract strategy games (or abstracts). <br>Definition creep is a big deal to me.<br><br>And Mark, I am not looking to kick your games out of IAGO.  I do want<br>them in, but realize that you may object to the way IAGO is going and<br>not want them there.  IAGO needs to respect the wishes of designers<br>out there.  I personally believe it is counterproductive to you, but<br>the decision is yours.<br><br>Also, please add your two cents (in a civil manner of course) and see<br>if you can get involved.  The IAGO World Tour can definitely use 2<br>player only combinatorial game theory games dominating it, so see if<br>you can get any.  This will set examples in place to prevent deviance.</div>
