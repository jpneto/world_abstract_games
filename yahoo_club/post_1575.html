    <div>Oust is a two year old game of mine that turns out to have *phenomenal* gameplay.  It mushroomed on three live play sites in the past two weeks after a long period of dormancy.  I was as surprised as anyone.  I stumbled onto it at Igfip after member Christina recommended it for implementation.<br><br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_Go_rules.pdf<br><br>Oust is number one out of 100 games on igGameCenter if you look at the stats for the past week.  And it's only been there for four days!  <br><br>  http://www.iggamecenter.com/stats/topplayed7.html<br><br>Part of that is the novelty and me participating in about half of the games.  But even at that it's truly a phenomenon.  I've been doing this for 17 years and I've never had a response anything like this.<br><br>Essen is the world's biggest game fair in the world's greatest game playing country - Germany!!  <br><br>  http://www.internationalespieltage.de/e000.php4<br><br>I'm going to Essen from October 22 to 25 mainly to visit with friends - proprietors of the big European sites that carry my games and fellow world famous designers.  Everyone will be there.  It was too late to get a table for this year but I'll be easy to spot.  I'll be wearing a T-shirt with a big MSG logo, front and back, and carrying a Go board under my arm.  I want to play Oust and only Oust.  See you there!<br><br>-Mark<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
