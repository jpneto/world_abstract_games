    <div>Jorge and Ralf,<br><br>Thanks for the comments.<br>Animals seem a good substitute for numbers; perhaps<br>smaller animals would represent smaller<br>numbers.<br><br>Also, if you find that the game ends quickly, you<br>should think more carefully about certain moves. Usually<br>there is a defense that can turn the game around. I<br>have found that draws are not common. There is usually<br>a winner.<br><br>Believe it or not, Ascent is<br>related to Mancala !<br><br>Greg</div>
