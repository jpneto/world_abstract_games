    <div>Here's a sample game to show Forms' mechanics:<br><br>BWBW<br>WBWB<br>BWBW<br>WBWB<br><br>Black plays c2-d2, resulting in:<br><br>BWBW<br>WBWB<br>BWEB<br>WBWB<br><br>White plays b4-a4, resulting in:<br><br>WEBW<br>WBWB<br>BWEB<br>WBWB<br><br>Black plays a2-b2 (threatening b3-a3 immediate mate):<br><br>WEBW<br>WBWB<br>EBEB<br>WBWB<br><br>White plays a3-b3 to avoid mate (note that the white piece at a4 has been abandoned/captured):<br><br>EEBW<br>EWWB<br>EBEB<br>WBWB<br><br>Black plays b1-c1 (note that the white piece at a1 has been abandoned/captured):<br><br>EEBW<br>EWWB<br>EBEB<br>EEBB<br><br>White has b3-a2 immediate mate but he doesn't see it.  He plays c3-d3 instead (note that the stones at b2 and b3 are abandoned/captured):<br><br>EEBW<br>EEEW<br>EEEB<br>EEBB<br><br>Black misses d2-d3 immediate mate.  He plays d2-c3 instead, which is almost as good (note that the stones at c1 and d1 are abandoned/captured):<br><br>EEBW<br>EEBW<br>EEEE<br>EEEE<br><br>White plays d4-c4:<br><br>EEWE<br>EEBW<br>EEEE<br>EEEE<br><br>Black plays c3-b4 mate (the stone at d3 is abandoned/captured):<br><br>EBWE<br>EEEE<br>EEEE<br>EEEE<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
