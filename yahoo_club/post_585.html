I had no idea they were so many!! How many modern variants <br>(modern meaning less than 100 years) do you guess there are?<br><br>> Kalah is really an invented variant and was created by William J. <br>> Champion (USA)in 1958. It is one of the few solved Mancala <br>> variants, besides Dakon, MiniMancala, and Oware.<br><br>Thanks, I updated the author info.<br><br>Cheers, Joao Neto</div>
