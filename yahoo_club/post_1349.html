Your being offended or<br>threatening to sue, does show anything here as being illegal.<br><br>You are on record saying I have supported illegal activities.  Which<br>illegal activities Ralf?  Name which illegal activities I support, so<br>you can show you are not guilty of libel.  If not, then I demand you<br>post a retraction.<br><br>About the only area I can think of that might be illegal is I called<br>you Mr. Herman(n).  I thought that was your last name (so much for me<br>not picking up on Mark's insulting joke).  I am sorry if you were<br>offended by that.  I did think at the time your last name might be Herman.<br><br>If you would rather myself contact you privately to iron this out,<br>please let me know if I should contact you with your email address.  I<br>am willing to discuss this offline and get it ironed out by you.  If<br>you aren't going to respond that way, and insist on continuing here. <br>Then we can just let this issue rest then.  You can have the last<br>word, which is is libelous, and call it a day.  I have too many things<br>to worry about here to concern with pettiness and filling this board<br>with personal squabbles.</div>
