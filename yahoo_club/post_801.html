The only sense in which finer-grained ideas<br>> of a 'weaker' or 'stronger' position are meaningful is<br>> through failure of the players to completely perceive<br>> the structure of the game, either through strong depth<br>> or weak clarity.  So I suppose that a game with good<br>> 'drama' is one where there is an easily-perceived<br>> indicator that correlates strongly (but not reliably)<br>> with won positions.  Chess is definitely a good<br>> example for this...'material advantage' can be defined<br>> and perceived much more easily than whether a position<br>> is won.  Your mileage may vary on what qualities of a<br>> position are easily perceived, though...I'm unaware of<br>> any similarly obvious indicators for Hex, but I'm a<br>> newbie, so maybe I just don't know what they are.<br>><br>> -Andy<br>><br>><br>> --- Ralf <Peace_Panther@...> wrote:<br>><br>> > --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, joao_neto_1970<br>> > <no_reply@y...><br>> > wrote:<br>> > ><br>> > > Mark Thompson's article 'Defining the Abstract'<br>> > refers four<br>> > > qualitative features of abstract games: depth,<br>> > clarity, drama and<br>> > > Depth:<br>> > >  Good - Go<br>> > >  Bad - Tic Tac Toe<br>> ><br>> > Somebody said:<br>> > "Playing Draughts is like looking into a well, while<br>> > playing Chess<br>> > is like watching over an ocean." -- Probably Go is<br>> > like studying the<br>> > universe.
