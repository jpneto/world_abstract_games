    <div>I know that I am about 1 year late.<br>However I would like to point out why I don't agree with you, Mark.<br><br>Do you consider standard chess to be an Abstract Strategy Game ?<br>Yes ?<br><br>Then consider that in Chess, by the luck of the draw (of colors), will <br>probably receive a more advantageous starting arrangement than the <br>other player (i.e. will be white).<br><br>Even in one of the staples of abstracts (Hex) one of the player will <br>receive a more advantageous starting arrangement. Indeed he will <br>receive a WINNING starting arrangement (i.e. it will be the swapper).<br><br>In ALL games which are not theoretically drawn,the advantage will be <br>decided by elements outside the games (i.e. the pairing and color choosing mechanism) which are often random.  <br>If you want to neutralize this effect you will have to play 2 games, <br>one with black and one with white.<br><br>So, would you consider abstract a game defined as the sum of two <br>Chess960 games with swapped colors ?<br><br>Best Regards,<br>Maurizio<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Wilfried Hou Je Bek<br>> <wilfriedhoujebek@> wrote:<br>> ><br>> > ... because the randomness is only part of<br>> > the initial configuration, perhaps it should be<br>> > included.<br>> > <br>> <br>> "only"?
