    <div>For those of you who enjoy Cannon (or are interested in knowing more<br>about it) I have setup the Cannon Database.  This is the official<br>archive of Cannon games (not just games played at Super Duper Games).<br> It features a database with search capabilities, a free-form area to<br>play through these games or setup your own positions, and a (mildly<br>intelligent) AI opponent.  It can be found at<br>http://cannon.daltons.ca.  If you've never played the game, you really<br>must try it.  It has quickly become a favourite for me.  Of course,<br>you can play for free against real people at Super Duper Games<br>(http://games.daltons.ca).<br><br>Thanks for listening!<br>Aaron<br>Cannon DB: http://cannon.daltons.ca<br>Super Duper Games: http://games.daltons.ca</div>
