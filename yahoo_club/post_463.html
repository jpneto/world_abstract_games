    <div>Crosse, published by TSR.  My paraphrase of the (longish) rules:<br><br>object: A checkers variant won by having no piece of your own left, <br>or exactly four pieces that occupy the corners of a central 4x4 area.<br><br>board: 10x10 checkerboard whose central 2x2 is out-of-play, and the<br>other 12 squares in the central 4x4 are all in-play but follow a<br>counter-clockwise direction.  The other, alternating squares in the <br>checkerboard pattern are in-play.<br><br>capture: Mandatory, maximum sequence of checkers-style captures by <br>jumping; in the central 4x4 this can be orthogonal.  If no capture is <br>available, an attempted move is made as follows.<br><br>chance: There's a dice that specifies the direction (forward or <br>backward) and distance (range not given in the booklet), of a move.<br><br>move: The dice is rolled and a piece is moved to an empty square whose<br>direction (forward, backward, or sideways in the central 4x4) and<br>distance are dictated by the dice roll.<br><br>crosse: When a player occupies all four corners of the central 4x4, <br>his back row is cleared of his pieces, and he keeps rolling the dice <br>and moving so long as pieces are moved into his back row, and removed <br>from play.<br><br>-- William Chang (Saratoga CA)<br><br>p.s. the other three TSR abstracts (Chase, Kage, Steppe) seem more<br>interesting...  Kage is like Quoridor; Steppe stacks tangram-shaped<br>pieces; Chase uses dice as playing pieces on a wrap-around hexagonal<br>board.</div>
