    <div>The Human playing community, if large and with<br>professional players, would give a nice estimative of the game<br>depth, if the game itself is not very very complex<br>(hmmm... is Go a very complex game?)<br><br>For simple<br>games, it could be possible to create different playing<br>strategies, tuning them in order to get 2 out of 3 playing<br>levels from random until perfect play. <br><br>Anyway,<br>would the number of playing levels be a good estimate<br>for game depth? At least it seems so, since there are<br>more playing levels of Go than Chess.<br><br>Joao<br>Neto<br><br>ps: can you post the article's URL?</div>
