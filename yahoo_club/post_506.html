    <div>I am well aware that many people in France and Germany, and in the <br>United States for that matter, passionately oppose the war in Iraq.  <br>But you cross several lines when you compare Guantanamo to a <br>concentration camp, or neocon foreign policy to the Nazi concept of <br>total war.  There are no gas chambers or crematoria at Guantanamo, <br>and the U.S. is not planning to exterminate entire peoples.  If you <br>want your political opinions to be taken seriously, focus on the <br>facts at hand without making wildly exaggerated historical <br>comparisons.  And do it on a different board.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf Gering" <br><Peace_Panther@h...> wrote:<br>> <br>> Another blind American.
