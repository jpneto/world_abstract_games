    <div>I am new to this group and hope I am not overstepping bounds here.  I<br>have joined because I love abstract strategy games and am interested<br>to see what the current 'buzz' is.  I also maintain a hobby site (100%<br>free, no advertising) for the playing of such games completely<br>asynchronously (which is great when you don't have large blocks of<br>contiguous time).  It's called Super Duper Games and can be found at<br>http://games.daltons.ca.  I just finished implementing the commercial<br>game Cannon (with permission of course) and we have 12 other freely<br>available games as well (and more on the way).  Our little community<br>is small, but growing, and very friendly.  Feel free to come check us out!<br><br>I look forward to the discussions here.<br>Cheers!<br>Aaron</div>
