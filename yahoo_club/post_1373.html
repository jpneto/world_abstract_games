    <div>Your description is technically more accurate, and programmers are<br>advised to take that approach.  When one player has claimed more than<br>half of the cells, the game is effectively over and the program should<br>end the game and declare a winner.  My way of stating the object is<br>simpler though and so I use that, assuming that programmers will know<br>what to do and that losing players will have the good sense to resign<br>if allowed to play on when they can't possibly win.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Mark,<br>> <br>> I have a suggestion for a revised "Object of the Game"<br>> <br>> current:<br>> <br>> OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>> When the board is completely filled with stones, the player with the <br>> majority of stones on the board wins:<br>> <br>> proposed:<br>> <br>> OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>> When it no longer becomes possible for one player to overtake the other <br>> player in number of stones, the game ends<br>> and the player with the majority of stones on the board wins.
