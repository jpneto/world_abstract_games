    <div>> I think you need to clarify just what these <br>> "liberties" are. Does this mean simply that <br>> a stone is allowed to touch no more than two <br>> other stones, and if a chain of friendly stones<br>> is sandwiched between two enemy stones it <br>> is removed?<br>> <br><br>Yes!  Each stone has exactly two liberties.  No stone can be adjacent <br>more than two stones, and any stone or series of stones(all of one <br>color) which has had all its liberties taken by opposing stones(the <br>other color) are removed from the field and returned to their owner <br>for future play.<br><br><br>> What if I have 6 stones whose centers are at the <br>> corners of a regular hexagon about 1.1 diameters<br>> on a side, leaving just enough room in the middle for an enemy <br>stone, <br>> but where the enemy stone could never connect with its allies, nor <br>be <br>> touched by two of my stones -- does that stone successfully <br>> invade "my" territory? I suppose so, based on the rules you give, <br>but <br>> somehow it seems to me that it shouldn't.<br><br>Such placement would violate the rules.  A stone must be placed <br>either adjacent another stone OR up to one and one-half stone <br>distance from any other.  Thus that opposing stone could not be <br>placed in the exact center of those six stones, but could be placed <br>adjacent one or two of them within that center.<br><br>To achieve the above formation would be quite an accomplishment, <br>since you would have to work these stones into this position.  You <br>could never achieve such a position by simple placement.<br><br>But you have offer a potential.  What if a completed loop only has <br>room for the placement of a single stone in its center(there is at <br>least one and one-stone distance from any stone in the loop)?  A <br>single stone placed in such a position could still be subject to <br>additional placements, since the subsequent placements would be <br>adjacent it.  The form and amount of these additional placements <br>would be completely dependent on the available space.  Needless to <br>say, these subsequent placement would not be allowed to make contact <br>with the completed string.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Refer to Message 555 for the rules to String Go.<br><br>Any spelling errors are either typos, or completely intentional. ;-)</div>
