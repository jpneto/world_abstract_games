    <div>Hi I'm a single woman, 46, disabled with<br>arthritis<br> and can no longer drive and I walk with a cane. I<br>live in<br> Winchester, Virginia and am looking for<br>friends with like<br> interests. I've always loved<br>card/board/video games, chess and puzzles, and wondered if you<br>knew of any organization for this or a<br> person<br>close to me that you know enjoys these things? Would<br>really appreciate it, it's<br> difficult to make friends<br>when one can't drive and lives in<br> a small town. I<br>may not be familiar with the modern games<br> played<br>today, but I can learn. Thanks for any<br>suggestions,<br>Miss V</div>
