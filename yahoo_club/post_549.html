    <div>My previous posting got me to thinking about curvature.  In this 1D <br>game, it is taken that each stone has exactly two liberties.  These <br>liberties need not be located 180 degrees from each other but can <br>take place anywhere around each stone.<br><br>So stone can be place anywhere on a 2D field, they just would not be <br>allowed to occupy spaces adjacent stones which have both liberties <br>taken.<br><br>This could create a 1D game of extreme depth and complexity.  As <br>captures are made, new and different lines could form.  And thus the <br>game could loop back on itself, just never cross an existing line.<br><br>Now imagine the same 1D game played in 3D space.  Maintaining the two <br>liberty restriction.  Those line segments could dip and curl, <br>creating an awesomely mind-boggling game.</div>
