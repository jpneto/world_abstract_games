    <div>> Another blind American. Too, sad!!!<br>> Ralf<br> <br><br>Dear Mr. Goering,<br><br>Since your lack of life experience is only exceeded by the shame you <br>feel for your great-grandfather, please find another forum to mouth <br>your idiotic invective. <br><br>Your infamous ancestor was noted for comments like, "Whenever I hear <br>the word culture, I reach for my revolver."  That sounds <br>distressingly like some of your comments.  Many of them suffer from <br>the same meanness of spirit, and dearth of wisdom.  To paraphrase <br>your babbling, "Whenever I hear the word American, I reach for my <br>anti-American soapbox."<br><br>Put those religious studies to good use -- get a life.</div>
