    <div>Please see http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_rules.pdf for a <br>write-up of my new game, Scribe.  There's a game board printout at <br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_board.pdf.<br><br>Scribe is a very unusual two player game.  It's a departure from my <br>usual design style, and I expect a departure from anything you've <br>ever seen.  You need three things to play Scribe: a pen, a blank <br>sheet of paper (the board is easy enough to draw), and a pretty good <br>memory.  There are 19 "glyphs" that you must either know or have <br>handy on a chart.<br><br>DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS<br><br>There are 512 (2 exp 9) possible permutations of Xs and Os.  In half <br>of these, X owns less squares than O.  (X,O) =3D {(0,9),(1,8),(2,7),<br>(3,6),(4,5)}.  Of those 256 permutations, exactly half are wins for <br>X and half are wins for O in Scribe.  So if they both play randomly, <br>they will each have exactly 50% chance of winning.  There will be no <br>advantage in moving first or second in random play.  I tried to make <br>the subgroups equitable as well.  For example if X has 3 squares and <br>O has 6, they both have 42 possible winning permutations.<br><br>Not every subset was perfect.  For example if X has zero and O has <br>9, that's a win for O.  But the discrepancies were negligible.<br><br>Though the glyphs may seem arbitrary, they're not.  The 1 square <br>glyphs and 2 square glyphs could only take one shape.  The 3 and 4 <br>square glyphs were dictated by equitability requirements.  There was <br>some wiggle room with the larger glyphs, especially the 7 square <br>glyphs.  But there I chose palatable, recognizable patterns over <br>awkward, random looking patterns such as the "scrambled eggs" <br>glyph.  Overall there was very little choice in glyph selection <br>given the constraints of equitability and aesthetics.<br><br>Draws cannot occur in Scribe.<br><br>Mark Steere</div>
