Your opponent can't capture two of your stacks in one<br>turn.  The only way you can't split one of your stacks into two of<br>your own stacks is when your last remaining stack has only one of your<br>checkers in it.  In test playing, it seemed fairly easy to avoid that<br>situation.<br><br>The mystery here is how the "30 minutes" playing time was arrived at.<br> I test played it for about that long and the end was nowhere in<br>sight.  It just seemed like endless churning.</div>
