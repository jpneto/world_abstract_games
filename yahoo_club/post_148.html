    <div>Hi Joao,<br><br>Because of Time Vectors having a fourth dimension which is cyclical and<br>periodic, we think it has pushed any possible first player advantage beyond<br>any trivial algorithm.<br><br>Notice that with five moves in Qubic, a situation of two three-in-a-row<br>constructs can be established.  In Time Vectors a similar un-blockable<br>structure can be constructed using only four moves.  This can be done using<br>the first and third points in the two lines as intersecting points in<br>opposite quadrants, and divergent points in the other two opposing quadrants<br>run between these two first points; one in a clockwise direction and the<br>other in a counterclockwise direction.<br><br>The various quadrants in the fourth dimension (NE, NW, SW, SE) are such that<br>there are no endpoints defined by the game board such as there are in the<br>top and bottom tier of the third dim. and the endpoints in each grid (1st &<br>2nd dims.).  Starting in any one quadrant, the next increment in the fourth<br>dimension is to an adjacent quadrant.  This rendering of the fourth<br>dimension as periodic and bi-directional-cyclical seems to disperse the<br>first move advantage as it exists in the other tic-tac-toe forms.  At least<br>if there is one, we haven't found it, but we haven't put it to the computer<br>test yet.<br><br>I have had this put to me before several times, the last time by Steven<br>Tavener in England.  He is going to try to prove the first move advantage.<br>I haven't heard from him yet.  If you also wish to tackle this problem,<br>e-mail me personally.  mailto:davidb@....<br><br>I really need to know though, if this is the case.  If you can show me an<br>algorithm, by all means do so.  We have played this game among my friends<br>here for quite a number of years, and have been frustrated by the elusive<br>first-move algorithm which we have also thought to exist.  The longest game<br>so far took the winner nineteen moves, there has never been a draw.  First<br>and second players have won and lost more according to their familiarity<br>with evolving strategies than with their position as first or second to<br>move.  But the first-move-wins algorithm could still be out there lurking,<br>ready for the people bright enough to find it.<br><br>Thank you very much for your observation.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>David Barnhart [barneypaloma]<br><br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: joao_neto_1970 [mailto:no_reply@yahoogroups.com]<br>Sent: Friday, March 01, 2002 4:02 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] About Time Vectors<br><br><br>  Hi<br><br>  This game seems a kind of Qubic (4x4x4 tic-tac-toe) which<br>  was proved to be a 1st player win. It seems to me that<br>  Time Vectors has more threath possibilities than Qubic,<br>  implying (?) on an even greater first player advantage.<br><br>  In your playtesting, what were the stats for 1st wins?<br>  Any draws?<br><br>  Cheers,<br><br>  Joao Neto<br><br>  ps: you can play a game of Qubic at http://playqubic.com/ or<br>  http://users.erols.com/ferrisbb/tictactoe.html<br><br><br><br><br>        Yahoo!
