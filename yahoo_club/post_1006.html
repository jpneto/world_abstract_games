    <div>The Train Journey<br><br>Travelling on a train on a quite cold and blistery day the traveller<br>is surprised when the man opposite stands up, goes to the window and<br>opens it wide. Politeness lasts a minute or two of icy blast until the<br>traveller stands up and angrily closes the window, looking pointedly<br>at the man opposite. The man responds a few minutes later by opening<br>the window again. After shutting, opening, shutting, opening again the<br>traveller is worked up enough to speak. "Just what is your<br>game?"......"Draughts" the man replies. <br><br>(English joke. "Draughts" is a board game as well as an icy blast.<br>Doesn't work too well with "checkers")</div>
