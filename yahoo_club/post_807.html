    <div>>There are two kinds of "depths": vertical and horizontal.<br><br>What do you mean by this?<br><br>>> I agree that I am bad at Reversi (or the modern only half so good <br>>> plagiarism Othello) because I find the turning over of pieces <br>>> confusing. The same for Yinsh. Does that make a game "bad"? <br><br>No, and I do find Reversi/Othello a good game. A good game may not <br>be 100% ok in every feature. This is not a competition, my main <br>point is to be able to point at a known game and say 'this is a good <br>example of good/bad X' without implying that it is good or bad in <br>general. To rate an abstract game we would need a well-defined <br>criteria and we don't have one.<br><br>>> When I started to play Go I found the game very unclear, just <br>>> because of the giant size of the board, but when I became a 5-kyu<br>>> and better, my perception changed.<br><br>I do think GO is one (or the one, who knows?) of the best abstract <br>games ever invented, but I would not say it has very good clarity. <br>As you said, a beginner finds GO a hard game (and a bit boring too <br>if I may add) but it will compensate your effort. Most games with <br>better clarity will not be able to return as much to a player as GO. <br><br>>> Some people may say: If you claim that the drama is weak in Hex, <br>>> it's because you don't understand what is going on, because you <br>>> are a poor player.<br><br>I don't need nobody to tell me that, I'm a bad Hex player ;-) <br><br>But I agree with Andrew, Hex has better decisiveness than bad drama.<br><br>Jo=E3o</div>
