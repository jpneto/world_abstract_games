There are <br>lots <br>> of Territorial Games and Connection Games recently such as Cats & <br>> Dogs, Clobber, Scarab, Blokus, Wong's Game and Alta.

The structure you've drawn is <br>a "quarter-orbit" (definition: a connected group which, together with <br>two adjacent sides of the board, completely encircles one or more <br>points of the board).  In one variant of Orbit, called Quarter-<br>Prohibition Orbit, the essential rule is:  "orbits capture and <br>prohibit, half-orbits capture and prohibit, quarter-orbits <br>prohibit."  This version develops more quickly than the standard <br>version, but the middle game is not as interesting.<br><br>> > 9.

For the same <br>reason, "invasion" is not possible in the usual sense --- however, a <br>portion of or all of your opponent's structure can sometimes be <br>destroyed, meaning that it is now permissible to play within it since <br>it no longer exists.  (BTW, it is permissible but never advantageous <br>to play within one of your own orbits).<br>><br>Steve<br> <br>> Gamely yours,<br>> <br>> TruthForum2001</div>
