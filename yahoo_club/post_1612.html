"The map *is* the territory".  The description of a game *is* the game.  In other words, a rulesheet describing the complete rules of the game does, in fact, constitute the game.

To me the set of rules is almost the only thing that matters - just something to behold.  The structure.  Why the rules create a finite series of cycles, like in Tanbo and Cephalopod, etc.  <br><br>A set of rules is kind of like DNA though.  It'll give rise to common tactics, and it'll generate a certain what I call gameplay - the experience of the game "separate" from the rules.  Does it start out slow and pick up speed, or have flat spots along the way, etc.  Can the game control your mood?  I think games of annihilation may be more good mood / bad mood games than score counting games.  <br><br>Oust is a great example of a good mood / bad mood / all around tense game that ends in total annihilation.  You can't walk away from that unaffected.  At least I can't.  There's a distinct walking-the-plank feeling, and then it eventually becomes apparent who's leading the way on the plank.  So, while none of that needs to be mentioned on the rule sheet, the "Oust experience" will find commonality among those who play it. <br><br>-Mark=</div>
