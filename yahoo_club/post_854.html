    <div>Byte is played with a standard Checkers set.  The rules can be found at <br>bytegame.com.  If anyone is interested, I always keep a challenge open <br>at superdupergames.org.<br><br>Impasse is another game for Checkers sets I came out with a couple of <br>years ago (impasse.net) but which was virtually unknown until it also <br>appeared on SDG recently.  The Impasse instructions are somewhat <br>lengthy but I'm currently working on a single page rule sheet for it.<br><br>Draws and ties cannot occur in either Byte or Impasse.  Byte, after <br>five months of continuous play testing, seems particularly resistant to <br>first (and second) move advantage - though who knows what the future <br>may hold.<br><br>Mark Steere</div>
