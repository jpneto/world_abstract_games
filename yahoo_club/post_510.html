    <div>> Another blind American. Too, sad!!!<br><br>I agree that there's some sad blindness here. But it <br>belongs to the individual who undoubtedly considers <br>himself a humane and enlightened person, but who <br>cannot -- CANNOT -- stop seeing all people, all <br>texts, even all board games, as stereotypic <br>representations of the nations they hail from: and <br>can't even be persuaded that he's doing it, when <br>it's perfectly obvious to everyone else.<br><br>Ralf, have you ever noticed that no one else here has ever asked you <br>which country you're from? And no one else here is interested in <br>which country a new game is from? That's because we don't care. We <br>don't think it would give us any insight at all into who you are. It <br>doesn't matter to anyone except you. You, on the other hand, want to <br>know that about a person first thing, and when you find out, it makes <br>a difference to you. It informs the tone you take with that person, <br>what you say about that person, whether you show respect for that <br>person. Go back and read your own posts if you don't believe it. Even <br>your present post: it had to be "another blind American," not <br>just "another blind person" or "more blindness" -- it was important <br>to you to make sure everyone is aware that the person you criticize <br>is an AMERICAN.<br><br>Count up the posts you've written that have made a point of remarking <br>on national origins, and compare it with how many times other people <br>remark on such things. You're obsessed with this national origin <br>thing. Anyone as intelligent as you should be able to see that this <br>is a kind of bigotry. I point this out because I think the principles <br>you believe in are probably better than the way you've been living <br>them, and continue to hope that you will GROW UP.<br><br>After all, you do know a lot about games. If only you wouldn't be so <br>snippy all the time, I'd read your stuff with much more pleasure.</div>
