    <div>Since IAGO has offended you so much, please tell the world to ignore<br>IAGO, it is evil, and post the exact offense I did to you (I am not<br>sure if it is calling you Herman or not getting into an argument). <br>Please do this.  IAGO can use the publicity, and your ranting over and<br>over about it would cause more interest in it.<br><br>Well, short of that, you seriously need to tell me whether it was<br>myself calling you Herman (I am sorry, I thought it was your last<br>name), or is it my not declaring war on Mark.  Please let me know.  If<br>not that, then  please go with the worldwide boycott.</div>
