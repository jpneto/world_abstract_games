    <div>About Sid Sackson: A Gamut of Games (1982, page<br>134).<br> <br>"After Focus was printed in Scientific<br>American Magazine, several correspondents called my<br>attention to the possibility of the second<br>player<br>initiating the moves of the first player. (...) White can<br>continue until he sees a chance to profit by deviating.<br>And if he doesn't, he is still assured a draw.<br>My<br>answer to someone who plays in this manner, is not to<br>play with him."<br> <br>My answer to Sid Sackson:<br><br><br>"You are a foolish guy who is just offended that his<br>game doesn't work as pointed out in a renowned science<br>magazine. You ought to be ashamed to<br>coquet with such a<br>childish behavior! If you are a bad loser, you shouldn't<br>play at all!"<br> <br>Even Sackson didn't feel<br>comfortable with the solution given in Scientific American<br>which threatened to kill his game.<br> <br>For that<br>reason he wrote:<br> <br>"One of the following rules can<br>be adopted:<br> <br>1. If neither player can<br>immobilize the other, the <br> one who played second is<br>considered the loser.<br>2. Before the actual play of the<br>game begins, each <br> player in turn switches the<br>position of one of <br> his pieces with one of his<br>opponent's pieces. <br> The second player is not permitted<br>to make a <br> switch which will restore the<br>symmetry.<br><br><br>THE EXPOSITOR <br><br>(Panther)</div>
