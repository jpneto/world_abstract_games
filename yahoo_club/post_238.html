    <div>> What in the world is strange about these conclusions?  <br><br>It is strange that you didn't discover that Cleave is a childish <br>draw. Why did you not discover it? I think, because you look into the <br>wrong direction. You look at the endgame, but it is far more <br>important to try to kill a game in the opening. It is strange that so <br>many people such as Chris Huntoon and Christian Freeling invent <br>games, which are an early draw. It basically reveals that they are <br>not good game inventors. On the other hand, Kris Burm would never <br>invent such games, which testifies his supreme brilliancy. Chris <br>Huntoon has good ideas, but his games are often like unpolished <br>diamonds. Christian Freeling lacks originality. Most of his games are <br>ideas taken from other games: Dameo from Croda, Bushka from <br>Epaminondas, Emergo from Lasca, Medusa from Go. My impression of his <br>web site is: it is annoying. He runs down other games such as <br>Draughts, Bashne and Lasca with callow thoughts, not because they are <br>really bad, no, because he want to promote his own games, which are <br>merely clones. Somehow he feels he must justify his own "inventions", <br>because they are so close to other well-established games. His true <br>motives are rather obvious.<br><br>> Point well taken.  It is an embarrassing flaw.<br><br>Let's take another example:<br><br>English Draughts / Straight Checkers (is there anything like Gay <br>Checkers???) ---> 2 kings can win against one, except in one exotic <br>position which in actual games never occurs<br><br>International Draughts (10x10) ---> 3 Kings against one is usually a <br>draw<br><br>Guess which game is more drawish!<br><br>English Draughts suffers much more more draws in tournament play than <br>International Draughts, in spite of having an endgame which is far <br>less drawish.<br><br>Endgame analysis has to be taken with much caution.<br><br><br>> Let me quote Parlett's discussion of Epaminondas:  "I believe it <br>was <br>> later renamed Phalanx."  <br><br>I think there was a predececcor to Epaminondas played on a smaller <br>board which was (perhaps) called "Phalanx". It is described in Sid <br>Sackson's book: "A Gamut of Games.", but I don't have the book at <br>hand right now and here.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
