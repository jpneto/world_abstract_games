    <div>The 4th annual Cannon tournament sponsoered by Blue Panther LLC has concluded with Antoine Richard of Canada taking second place and Ola Mikael Hansson of Sweden now holding the honor of World Champion. In an act of generosity our new world champion gave away a Cannon set to a randomly drawn participant from the competition. <br><br>Although there were only 19 players this year we saw some fantastic matches. There were a total of 42 elimination matches in the first two rounds and a final game for a total of 43 altogether. Ola Mikael Hansson applied a juggernaut approach forming huge multiple cannon formations that once in place were indomitable. The tournament games as well as all other Cannon matches played at www.superdupergames.org are available for study at the Cannon PNG Database http://cannon.superdupergames.org/<br>=</div>
