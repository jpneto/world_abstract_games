    <div>>The solution: remove all the restrictions and<br>change the rule on <br>>movement to read. A piece can<br>move exactly as many spaces as <br>>there are empty<br>spaces (liberties) othogonally around that piece.<br><br><br>What is then the purpose of making connections? When<br>you connect<br>two stones, they reduce their own<br>moving capacity!<br><br>>(A possible variant would<br>make it even more Go like by stating <br>>number of<br>spaces a piece can go is exactly the same as number<br><br>>of liberties the group that the piece belongs in<br>have.) <br><br>It may be even more interesting than the<br>first proposal. With it<br>you already answered my last<br>question.<br><br>Another possible way, is to say that a stone may only<br>capture<br>another, if the number of friendly neighbors of the former<br>is <br>equal or greater than the number of friendly<br>neighbors of the <br>later.<br><br>>three move<br>equalization sound sufficient.<br><br>yes, I think so! You can<br>also use the Renju opening technique: one <br>player<br>places the first 3 stones, and the other decides which<br>side <br>to take.<br><br>About board size, I would<br>start on a 13x13 board. The 19x19 may <br>be too large<br>for non traditional and millenary games<br>;-)<br><br>Joao</div>
