Rush seems a lot more unusual, to<br>> me-- I haven't seen placement games with multiple sequential moves<br>> before (there's Checkers and Chinese Checkers, but they aren't<br>> placement games).  They both look interesting, though, thanks.<br>><br>> --Doug<br>><br><br>I hope you don't mind that I posted your memo to the Abstract Games<br>group.  The topic started here and yours is a good question that<br>others may share.<br><br>I understand what you're saying.  In Levee the goal is to rid the<br>board of all sequences of unoccupied points connecting the center to<br>either of his sides.  But to do so you have to connect stones.<br><br>Here are the differences though.  Hex is a two color game while Levee<br>is a one color game.  Hex can't be played on a rectangular grid<br>pattern because the black lines and white lines could cross each<br>other.  In Hex you must connect your two opposite sides with at least<br>one line, while in Levee you either need at least two lines connecting<br>your opposite sides, with the center sandwiched in between, or, as a<br>completely different goal, you could form a U around the center,<br>connecting both ends to one of your sides.  In my opinion all of this<br>makes Levee very different from Hex.  Sure, you could call it a twist<br>on Hex, but that's a big fuckin twist.</div>
