    <div>> The question is "Can an abstract game have random events after the<br>> coin toss but before the first move?".  To me the answer is obviously<br>> no.<br><br>After sleeping on it, it's obvious to me you're right: one of the<br>basic classic theorems about abstract games is that with perfect play<br>the outcome would always be the same (either first-player win, second<br>player win, or draw), and this obviously wouldn't hold if Chess960<br>mechanisms were allowed. So I'm joining the Steere camp. <br><br>Thompson Nonrandom Chess (which I described a few messages ago) would<br>be abstract, though...<br><br>Mark</div>
