    <div>> Question: Did any hex game show in the competition?<br><br>I submitted the following connection game, which has a winning <br>condition similar to that of Hex:<br><br>"Dipole" by Cameron Browne<br><br>Dipole is a 3D connection game for two players, Black and White.<br><br>The game is played on an 8x8 square grid of holes. The top and <br>bottom sides of the board are coloured black, and the left and right <br>sides are coloured white. <br><br>Players share a common pool of 32 dipoles, where each dipole <br>consists of a black and white sphere joined together. <br><br>Aim: A player wins by completing a connected chain of their colour <br>between their two sides of the board. Two spheres are connected if <br>they are orthogonally (squarely) adjacent or one rest directly upon <br>the other.<br><br>Play: The board is initially empty. Players then take turns either <br>1) placing a dipole on the board, or 2) swiveling a dipole as <br>follows.<br><br>1) A dipole can be placed anywhere that it sits stably, and may be <br>flat (with both spheres on adjacent empty points on the same level) <br>or tilted (with one sphere on an empty point on one level and the <br>other sphere resting at an angle on two or three surrounding pieces).<br><br>2) A dipole already on the board may be swiveled around the end with <br>the opponent's colour (that is, the end with the opponent's colour <br>stays fixed) as long as it sits stably after the move.<br><br>Over/under rule: If a connection of one colour passes over a <br>connection of the other colour, then the lower connection is cut.<br><br>Making your own set: The board may be easily made with an 8x8 grid <br>of washers, where each washer is the same diameter as the dipole <br>spheres. Dipoles can be made by gluing together two smalls balls or <br>joining pairs of beads with small pegs.</div>
