    <div>By the way, I have kicked the idea of chess moves determined by voting<br>around further, where a crowd plays a game of chess collectively.  I<br>am looking at "Vox Populi Chess":<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?subjectid=3DVoxPopuliChess<br><br>The idea here is divide the crowd up into 2 teams, and each team votes<br>on a move.  After both sides have made a move, members of the crowd<br>can end up switching sides.  Points are scored for staying with one<br>side or another.  It needs work, but that is the idea.</div>
