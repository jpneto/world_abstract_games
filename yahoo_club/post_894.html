    <div>Impasse is a game I created a couple of years ago, but which <br>remained virtually unknown until Aaron Dalton dredged it up from the <br>depths of obscurity and programmed it for SDG <br>(superdupergames.org).  <br><br>Now I've condensed the rules of Impasse onto a single page and so <br>now I'm kind of reintroducing it.<br><br>  http://www.impasse.net/Impasse_rules.pdf<br><br>Of course feel free to comment.  However, Impasse is, and has been <br>for some time, in its final release.<br><br>Impasse, like Checkers, is a true stacking game since true stacks of <br>checkers of height two truly occur during play.  Yes, the stacks <br>could be represented by a flipped over single checker.  Likewise in <br>Byte, for example a stack of four white checkers on top of four <br>black checkers could be represented by writing in pencil the <br>hexadecimal number "F0" on a disk of paper.  In both cases, it's <br>condiderably more convenient to simply employ the stacks, as <br>intended.<br><br>Dictionary.com definition of "stack": "An orderly pile, especially <br>one arranged in layers."<br><br>Mark</div>
