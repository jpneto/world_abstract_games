    <div>Cage's latest incarnation is improved.  The gameplay is much more slippery.  I didn't think the relaxed move restriction would make much difference but it does.  It adds a lot of new possibilities.<br><br>Cage rules:<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br><br>Usually when I find out a game is flawed my first instinct is to bury it, but in this case I knew exactly what to do right away.  I had already considered the current incarnation during the design phase but rejected it exactly because I thought it was too slippery - something I had inexplicably perceived as a bad thing at the time.  <br><br>I also rejected the current Cage incarnation at first because it makes the rules a tad more complicated.  I only use the level of complication necessary in my games and that's precisely where Cage is at right now.  <br><br>Cage is similar to Oust in rule complexity.  Simple concept for Oust: Bigger things grow while killing smaller things.  But people understand Oust at first like they understand Cage at first: incompletely.  There are always the predictable misunderstandings.  "Oh, I forgot I have to move again after I kill in Oust."  And "How do you start the game in Cage when there's nowhere to jump?"  Etc.<br><br>Oust rules:<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_rules.pdf<br><br>Cage is based on a powerful concept: slide inward and multiple jump outward in a churn.  In this case I fumbled a little before allowing the concept to realize itself.  I was getting in its way.<br><br>People ask me why I chose Cage for a name.  Cage is my most violent game.  Large multiple jumps occur often.  If you're not jumping, you're charging into the fray.  A comparison with cage fighting can't be avoided.</div>
