    <div>Believe or not...<br><br>The proprietor actually starts a new topic inviting commentary from<br>the members - whether or not to ban Ralf.  Then a few days later he<br>announces that he's deleting their commentary.  I think he's actually<br>trumped the type of crap that Ralf pulls.  I didn't even think it was<br>possible.  If I knew the proprietor was such a spineless communist I<br>wouldn't have wasted so much time there.  What an a-hole.  Turns out<br>he's a closet communist, higher in rank than even Ralf.
