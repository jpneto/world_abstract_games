    <div>Hi Mark,<br> <br>    Thanks for the information. I will add Moxie Plus Plus to my list if you<br>have no objections. I'm attaching my full list of 4x4 game as an attachment<br>in case you're interested. I did have Aera on my list but had no rules<br>information. I read your rules outline for it and have a couple questions<br>(see below). Also, what do you think of it as a game? <br> <br>Thanks,<br> <br>-Mike<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: markthomps [mailto:no_reply@yahoogroups.com]<br>Sent: Saturday, February 22, 2003 5:35 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: 4x4 Games<br><br><br>There was a game named "Aera," published by New Dimensions out of <br>Corvallis, OR, and reviewed in GAMES, April/May 1987. The essence of <br>it: each of the two players, Red and Blue, has 6 pieces in his own <br>color, numbered 1 to 6. Moving alternately, they drop them onto the <br>board, in numerical order, onto any vacant square. When the pieces <br>are all placed they alternately move a piece to any vacant square. <br>But the piece they are to move is determined by the numeric sequence.  <br> <br>I'm not clear on what you mean by "move is determined by the numeric<br>sequence". Does this mean that piece 1 must be moved first, followed by the<br>next higher surviving piece on the player's next move, etc.? <br><br>The object is to score points; one point is scored by forming a line <br>of your pieces, either orthogonal or diagonal. The first player to <br>score six points wins. <br> <br>I take it that scoring lines must be four pieces? Also what happens after a<br>line is formed and a point earned; does the line of pieces remain on the<br>board and the other player then takes his turn and the game continues? <br><br>Looking for a way to improve Moxie, I devised a game I call "Moxie <br>Plus Plus": The players, White and Red, alternately drop their pawns <br>onto the board. They have 8 pawns offboard at the start. White drops <br>first, but White may not move a Pawn until Red has moved. A Pawn may <br>move any number of squares orthogonally (as a chess rook), but only <br>if at the start of its turn there is a friendly Pawn in the adjacent <br>square either to the North or East (for White) or in the adjacent  <br>square either to the North or West (for Red). If such a move leaves  <br>the Pawn still adjacent to a friendly Pawn in the required direction, <br>the player may continue his turn.  If a move leaves an enemy piece  <br>sandwiched between the moving piece and another friendly piece, the <br>enemy is captured (custodian capture). The object is to form a line <br>of  four friendly pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally. The <br>board "wraps around" for the purpose of moving and for defining a <br>winning line, but not for the purpose of deciding whether a piece has <br>an adjacent friend in the required directions to be allowed to move.<br><br><br><br>Yahoo!
