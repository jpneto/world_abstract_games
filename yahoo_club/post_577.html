    <div>Hi,<br><br>I'm looking for information on two old connection games called<br>Roadblock and Squirt. These were mentioned by Martin Gardner in "Four<br>Unusual Board Games" from the Sixth Book of Mathematical Games from<br>Scientific American, 1963. This article also mentioned Zig-Zag, which<br>turned out to be a Hex-like game from 1932(!) so I'm quite interested<br>to dig up the other two.<br><br>These games predate 1963. Hasbro released a Roadblock in 1976 but <br>it's not the one.<br><br>Any help appreciated.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Cameron Browne</div>
