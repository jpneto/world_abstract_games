The "near equal chance of winning" part could be<br>> determined by expected outcome (play a large number of random games<br>> (how many?), and only accept an expected outcome in a certain interval<br>> (how liberal?), but this wouldn't always necessarily give a<br>> "reasonable" result (if there's only a very narrow set of moves<br>> leading to victory, but they're obvious to human players, for instance).<br>><br><br>Another "heap" problem.  I would argue here that is it near 50%<br>(perhaps standard chess being the criterion).

It was added because Mark whined that<br>playing the same position from both sides is flat out undoable.  Some<br>criterion needs to be set.

Anyhow, if people are here willing to have the<br>coin flip issue dealt with by playing both sides, this shouldn't be a<br>problem.
