    <div>"The higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of Draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of Chess.  In the later, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions with various and variable values, what is complex  . . .  is mistaken for what is profound." - `Murders in the Rue Morgue', Edgar Allen Poe<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>The majority of households have an old Checkers set sitting in a closet somewhere, gathering dust. Which is a shame, because many people do not understand or appreciate the sumptuous variety of games that may be played with just this simple set.  What's more, most are only familiar with the standard game of Checkers - which is the least interesting.  Many other forms of Checkers exist, and they offer greater depth and richness of play.<br><br>While the last century has seen an explosion of literally thousands of Chess variants, only a small handful have tried to experiment with the game of Checkers.  It is a game that offers a lot of untapped potential. <br><br> V. R. Parton published several pamphlets that progressed the field of Chess variants.  This is my amateur attempt of doing the same for Checkers.  I'll restrict myself to only newer, previously unpublished games.  I won't include any of my older variants (Fairy Tale Draughts, Tourney, etc.) that I've already implemented.  Most of these new games have actually been around for years, but only in private.  This is my first time making them public.  Some are modest variants.  Others are more elaborate.<br><br>ON VARIANTS<br><br>  <br>They are a number of reasons for the creation of new variants.  The most obvious and common is to take a familiar game and restore a sense of novelty to it.  That a variant may not always improve play, it will, at least, vary it.<br><br>The second is to take something created by others and customize it to suite one's own tastes and needs.	<br><br>Another reason is to challenge experienced players by presenting them with unfamiliar situations.  Departure from established game play also helps to reduce the disparity between players of different skill levels.<br><br>But another, more overlooked reason is understanding that Checkers is far from a perfect game. Furthermore, giving oneself over to the rigid mind set that there can only be a single, "proper" way to play - that is a road that leads to stagnation.  Innovation is needed to help refine and revitalize the rules.   Evolution is an ongoing process, and experimentation is an essential part of that process.  The orthodox game of today was the variant of yesterday.<br><br>Lastly, I hope the experience of being exposed to new variants will in turn stir in others ideas for even more new kinds of variants.<br><br>BAGELS<br><br>It is one of the basic tactics of Checkers to keep a piece on the edge of the board to protect it from being jumped.  I wanted to have a game that was purely positional - that is a piece's significance was based solely on its relationship to all the other pieces, not to the incidental geography of the board itself.  So I moved the game to a board without an edge - a torus.<br><br>A side effect of play on a torus is that promotions become unnecessary.  Pieces can keep cycling around and around the board until the game is resolved.<br>								<br>I had a previous game played on a torus -or donut shaped - board that I had called "Donuts."  So I decided to name this one "Bagels."  The rules for it can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1923<br><br><br>PERSEPHONE<br><br>Before I go any further, I should explain I have very personal connection when it comes to Checkers variants.  You see, at the age of six, when I first learned Checkers (that is to say the Anglo-American version, which, as far everyone around me knew or was concerned, was the ONLY way to play Checkers) I had an immediate - I would even say instinctive - dislike of the game.<br><br>My problem wasn't with the underlying structure of the game.  That I found appealing.  What I didn't care for was it's format.  This created all sorts of problems in my mind:<br><br>First, there was the skewed, asymmetrical layout of the board.<br><br>Then there was the awkward, zigzag movement of the pieces.<br><br>Last - and this was the thing that really got to me - was the fact that all pieces were bound to a single color of the checkerboard.  Which means an entire half of the board was not used at all! .  Even at the tender age of six I thought this was the height of absurdity.<br><br>In short, my issue with the game was that it was played diagonally.  In my mind, you could solve all these problems simply if just had the pieces move straight.<br><br>What I had done was independently create orthogonal Checkers.  Though in my version, the Kings still had the short movement of Anglo-American Checkers.  I wouldn't learn about "flying kings" until several years later.  <br><br>It was then that I realized that you could change around the rules of an established game and create a whole new game.  This one Checkers variant was the start of a life long hobby of game design.<br><br>As I have grown, and my understanding has deepened, it has only increased my disdain for the diagonal game.  For instance, in International Checkers, the most sophisticated form of the diagonal game, it requires four Kings in order to capture a lone King of the opponent. By contrast, only two Kings are necessary to capture a lone King in orthogonal Checkers.  And consider that draws are far too common in diagonal Checkers, while in orthogonal Checkers they are extremely rare.  The fact is that the diagonal game is intrinsically flawed.<br><br>To help illustrate this point, I took a very familiar game that is played on the full board, Chess, and altered it to so all the pieces are all bound to a single color of the board.  People can see how the game is diminished when you have 50% of the playing field removed.  I called the game "Savannah" and it is found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1928<br><br>Returning to Checkers variants, I realized constantly avoiding elements because you dislike them is destructive to the creative process.  Sometimes it is rewarding to take the very thing you hate and embrace it, to immerse yourself in it fully.<br><br>I realized that playing with half a board meant you could play two games with one board.  Each game would obfuscate the other.  Along with a player's skill, this would also test the players' powers of perception and their ability to separate the two.  This is a case where a computer would have a definite advantage over a human player.  <br><br>A further wrinkle would be that rather than having the player making a move on each of the games instead on their turn they must choose between the games to make one move.  Play becomes a kind of balancing act, where one cannot focus too long on one game at the expense of the other.<br><br>Having two games would also help with the problem with draws.  If one game is a draw that still leaves the second game to be won or lost.<br><br>I named the game "Persephone" after the mythic queen who was forced to split her time between two separate realms.  It can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1927<br><br>SIAMESE CHECKERS<br><br>A common approach to designing a variant is to take an established convention of a game and alter it or abolish it completely.  One of the most fundamental conventions of games like Checkers and Chess is that the two forces begin on opposite ends of the board and move in direct confrontation.  <br><br>I decided to change this up and have the two players forces of arranged on the same side.  Other than that, the game would follow the rules of Turkish Checkers.<br><br>At this point I should explain that Turkish Checkers is the orthogonal form of Checkers that traditionally has been played.  A Man in Turkish Checkers has three movements, instead of the usual two.  A step forward, or a step to the side, either to the left or the right.  This sideways, horizontal movement means the game lacks the usual element of forced progression which is a hallmark of the Checkers family.  This is usually cited as a shortcoming of the game.<br><br>In this format, however, where the pieces start off side by side, the peculiar sideways movement of the Turkish Man becomes accentuated and an essential part of the game.<br><br>This is probably one of the more unorthodox variants I have designed.  I decided to name it "Siamese Checkers" because the two camps start off joined together at the side, like Siamese twins.  It can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1924<br><br>CHEROKEE CHECKERS<br><br>Let me give everyone an idea of the dearth of Checkers variants that were around when I was growing up.  When my age was still in the single digits, I remember I had a cheap plastic and cardboard set of Checkers with a single sheet of rules for Checkers (Anglo-American Checkers, that is.)  The slip of paper also included what it pronounced were two "exciting" variants.  The first was Anglo-American Checkers played losing style.  The second was Diagonal Checkers.<br><br>For those who might not be familiar with Diagonal Checkers, let me explain.  Instead of the pieces being set up along rows, as usual, they are arranged in opposite corners in a series of diagonals.  (I have also seen this same game referred to as "Corner Checkers.") With the exception of the opening set up, the game is played exactly the same as Anglo-American Checkers.  Pretty "exciting," huh?<br><br>The thing is, when a friend and I decided to give Diagonal Checkers a try, we thought because the game was set up at a 45-degree angle, that meant it was supposed to be played at a 45-degree angle as well.  And the game is just about unplayable like that.  So we never bothered with it again.<br><br>A couple years ago I was flipping through a book of games rules, when I chanced upon diagram showing Diagonal Checkers.  My memory suddenly flashed back to the one and only time I ever tried playing it.<br><br>Now, as I stated above, the problem with the Turkish Checkers is because the Man moves in an inverted T formation, it lacks forced progression.  It occurred to me the solution was to take the misinterpretation of Diagonal Checkers from my childhood and apply it to Turkish Checkers.  <br><br>The pieces would be set up in opposing corners.  Men could only move outward, with two directions, toward the opposing camp.  Finally, there would be an orthogonal Checkers game with true forced progression.<br><br>"Cherokee Checkers" is just a name that popped in my head one day and stuck.  So I gave the game a Native American motif.  It can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1925<br><br>EUROPA<br><br>Which now brings us to the half a variant I mentioned in the title.  (This will all make sense in a moment.)  As I've stated before, my personal preference is, and always has been, for the orthogonal style of Checkers.  But I realize many Checkers players form an attachment to the kind of Checkers they are familiar with.  And International Checkers is the most popular form of Checkers played in the world.<br><br>So to make Cherokee Checkers more palatable to International players, I decided to do a second variant where I added the popular backwards capturing rule from the International game.  Personally, I have always considered the two elements that distinguish International Checkers, the larger board and the backwards captures, as ways to compensate for the shortcomings inherent to the diagonal game.  I think Cherokee Checkers is tactically rich enough as it is.  That adding backwards capturing onto it is a case of "gilding the lily."  But this was about trying to make the game more appealing to others.<br><br>Now those of you who are more familiar with Checkers variants are probably saying at this point that this game is shaping up to be nearly identical to a game by Benedikt Rosenau by the name of Harzdame.  And for those who are not familiar with Harzdame, information about the game can be found here:<br><br>http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45764/harzdame<br><br>Here is a case of two people reaching the same point by approaching it from opposite directions.  I wanted to take Turkish Checkers and make it more like International Checkers, and Rosenau wanted to take International Checkers and make it more like Turkish Checkers.  <br><br>The main difference between the two games lies in the opening set up.  Harzdame uses 21 pieces while Europa uses 16.  And while 21 pieces is closer to the 20 pieces of International Checkers, it is also played on a smaller board.  True, the game uses the full board with a total of 64 spaces, while International Checkers is played on half the squares a decimal board, with 50 spaces.  But the difference is one of density vs. distance.<br><br>The second divergence lies in the size of the promotion area.  In Harzdame, the crownhead is 11 spaces, in Europa it is 7.  Compare that to the 4 spaces in Anglo-American Checkers, the 5 in International Checkers and 8 in Turkish Checkers.  <br><br>One of the elegant traits I have always admired about Checkers, is that by the time that Kings come into play, the pieces have become so sparse and spread about the board, a long range piece becomes a necessity.  <br>				<br>Also, keep in mind, that the Kings in orthogonal Checkers are far more powerful than their diagonal counterparts.  In the diagonal game, four Kings are required to capture a lone King.  While in the orthogonal game, only two are needed.  It seems to me the direction that should be taken would be towards making promotions harder, not easier.<br><br>More is not always better.<br><br>The other main difference is that in Harzdame the pieces at laid out in step fashion, while Europa is in block fashion.  I have used the block style before in other orthogonal games, such as Aries and Euclid - even Siamese Checkers, above. It just seems to me the block style is more organically suited to a game played in the orthogonal plane.<br><br>I decided not to publish Europa because it was so very similar to Harzdame.  But it would be interesting to see how the games compare and contrast.<br><br>I had called the game Europa in the vein of naming games that use diagonal "flying Kings" (a.k.a. Queens) after queens from classical mythology.  Also, the name was meant to invoke that it was a blend of Turkish Checkers from eastern Europe and International Checkers from western Europe.<br><br>MARCH HARE CHECKERS<br><br>It is important when designing a variant that one does not feel the need to reinvent the wheel.  There have been numerous interesting concepts dreamt up for Chess variants, and some of them translate quite well into Checkers.<br><br>Case in point is V. R. Parton's March Hare Chess. In that game, on his the turn, the player makes two moves, first one of his own pieces, then one of his opponent's pieces.  When applied to Checkers, with its elements of forced progression and compulsory captures, it can make for some interesting situations.<br><br>For the longest time, I had been avoiding experimenting with International Checkers.  I knew it was the most popular form of Checkers in the world, and I wanted to go down the road less traveled.  But I figured it was time to start exploring.  The next few games all use International Checkers for a basis.<br><br>I had to make a slight modification to the rules so that the player loses if he's reduced zero or one pieces.  Otherwise the endgame tends to degrade into shifting the same pieces back and forth, over and over.<br><br>"March Hare Checkers" can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1919<br><br>JANUS<br><br>Moving both sides in March Hare Checkers led to me this idea:  what if the two sets of pieces are owned by neither player.  Rather the players take turns playing the one side against the other.  The loser would the first player unable to complete a move because all of a single side's pieces have been either captured or stalemated.  This transforms Checkers into an elaborate form of Nim.<br><br>I named this after the god of duality, "Janus."  Here it is:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1917<br><br>HERA<br><br>I have never liked the backwards capturing of International Checkers.  I know, I know, backwards captures opens up the possibility of all sorts of marvelous strategies and all the rest.  But the simple fact is that backwards captures violates the fundamental spirit of the game. In other words, it goes against the grain.  Even in Turkish Checkers, with all the sideway-ness of the Men, even they never once move backwards. <br><br>But the thing about the Men in Turkish Checkers is that they have three directions of movement.  And this give them a flexibility that those who grew up playing with the limited movement of the Men in the conventional, diagonal game simply are not used to.  And this flexibility gives the Turkish Man more potential in the setting of traps.<br><br>As I have said before, sometimes it is best to embrace the very thing you hate about a game.  I decided to let pieces not only capture backwards, but move backwards as well. This gives the Men four directions of movement.   It creates some unique situations that those who are familiar with the regular game will find unusual.<br><br>I named this game "Hera," after the queen of the gods.  Here is the link:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1916<br><br>KITTY CORNER<br><br>A common "house rule" is that the player first to get a piece Kinged is declared the winner.  Since Checkers involves forced progression and mandatory captures, I thought it be an interesting twist to turn that idea on its head.  The first player forced to get a piece Kinged is the loser.<br><br>I always appreciated the Nim game Wyt Queens and that fact that no matter where the pieces are located on the board, they will always be inevitably drawn to the same space in the corner.<br><br>I decided to merge these two concepts together.  The player must avoid moving a piece into the opposite corner while trying to draw his opponent toward his own corner.   To my knowledge, it is the first game of attainment played Misere style.<br><br>I understand the term "Kitty Corner" is an Americanism.  To anyone who has never heard it before, it means "the diagonally opposite corner."  The page for it is here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1918<br><br>SULTAN CHECKERS<br><br>Joseph Boyer invented "Royal Checkers" to be played as a variant of International Checkers.  But really the concept can be applied to any type of Checkers.<br>Designating one specific piece as "royal" does change the essential nature of the game.  The focus shifts to two specific pieces, and all the other pieces are subordinate to the defense or capture of the royal piece.<br><br>I wanted to transfer the game to one of my favorites, Turkish Checkers.  Also, to suit the change I would use the honorifics in their Turkish form.  One alteration I made is to put the Sultans on either side of the board, away from each other.  When they were close to one another, it created too many issues in game play.<br><br>Since Turkish Checkers is slow to progress to begin with, just getting a Sultan all the way across the board to promote is an accomplishment in and of itself.  So I made that a secondary way to win.<br><br>Below is the link for "Sultan Checkers":<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=3Dshow;id=3D1920<br><br>I hope that you found at least one of these variants to your interests and will give it a try. <br><br><br>"My computer beat me at Checkers, but I sure beat it at kick boxing."  - Emo Phillips</div>
