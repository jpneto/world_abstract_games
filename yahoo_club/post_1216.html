    <div>http://www.usacheckers.com/156openingdeck.php<br><br>This is akin to Chess960 by the way.  Would anyone say that the<br>American Checker Association no longer plays an abstract strategy game<br>when it used such a deck?<br><br>Just curious about this.  I was iffy on Chess960 in its standard form,<br>until I saw that the American Checker Federation uses the 3-move<br>opening deck.<br><br>- Rich</div>
