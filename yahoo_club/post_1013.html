    <div>By the way, anyone sufficiently close to Ann Arbor, Michigan might be<br>interested in attending the U-Con this November 17-19. Most of the<br>U-Con is RPG's, but on Saturday, Clark Rodeffer is sponsoring his<br>annual "Abstract Games Tournament", where some of us compete in<br>various games chosen mostly at random. I think there have been from<br>7-10 players in recent years. Last year I played Emergo, Yinsh, *Star,<br>Twixt, Byte, Hexmeister, Gyges, and Domina. Other players played<br>different games.<br><br>This year I'm also going to sponsor on Saturday, for the first time, a<br>tournament in Chess Variants. I plan to model it on the AGT, and<br>expect to have homemade equipment available for Quickchess, Tori<br>Shogi, Alapo, Flip Shogi, Whale Shogi, Caissa, Congo, Alice Chess, and<br>Fergus Duniho's Extra Move Chess. The selection was intended to be of<br>several CV's that look promising and quick-playing, so people can get<br>as much variety as possible in the short time available.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br><br><br>=</div>
