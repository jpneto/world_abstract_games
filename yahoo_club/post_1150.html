    <div>As part of IAGO, I was looking to define what would or would not be<br>represented by by the organization.  I have had heavy argument that<br>kriegspiel and backgammon need to be excluded, but I would beg to<br>differ.  Anyone else have any comments regarding this?  What are your<br>thoughts?</div>
