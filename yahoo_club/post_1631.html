    <div>Boardgame Geek has an, "interesting" way of classifying what are abstract strategy games.  I have try to take into account what they qualify as "abstract strategy games" but end up feeling the approach they use is too broad.  The site will throw a Tetris-like game like FITS under abstract strategy games, for lack of knowing where else to put it.  Dominoes is put under there, as is Ingenious. <br><br>Well, this might not be important, but Boardgame Geek is, by default, THE reference site for everything boardgames, and is a place of influence.  Because of this, I believe it would be beneficial for people who have an interest in abstract strategy games, on here, to also pop in there from time to time, and post, and read.  To go in and end up calling Boardgame geek on this game or that being classified as an abstract strategy game, or a game NOT being one (see Through the Desert) would be of help I believe.  Also, it would enable people who are "purists" regarding abstract strategy games, to get in contact with people who aren't and understand what they are thinking.  Getting involved would also help give abstracts a better voice, and get more solid boundaries.<br><br>Anyhow, here is the "forum", if anyone is interested:<br>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/4666/abstract-games<br><br>Perhaps added attention will make sure that abstract strategy games are treated as more than just a "junk drawer".</div>
