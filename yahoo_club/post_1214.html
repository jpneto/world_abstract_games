    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Larry Wheeler" <br>> Korneliussen's pie rule, if I understand it right, gives the second<br>> player the option to switch sides. There is the possibility that the<br>> second player can win (easily) no matter what the first player does,<br>> but I don't know how often that would happen in practice (probably not<br>> often). Hutnik's rule would cope better with this case, assuming the<br>> second player's winning strategy isn't obvious.<br><br>The switching sides happens before the game begins.  You don't switch<br>at ANY time.  Unless positions are that vulnerable, an easy win can't<br>happen.  And if it did, then the first player played badly (think of<br>it akin to Fool's Mate).<br><br>> When you speak of "the pie rule moving pieces", is that the idea of<br>> having the first player rearrange some of the pieces (rather than<br>> moving by the rules)?<br><br>I think it can be either.  Korneliussen's Rule is something that needs<br>to be finalized here.  It was my idea to take what was discussed and<br>make it practical.  It isn't set.<br><br>I do believe the adjusting of time is likely the single best way to<br>handle things here in terms of being true to the integrity of a game,<br>while offering sufficient shades/layers in set up, that it works for<br>good handicapping.  In chess, a case of using progression set up of<br>white getting more than one move to start breaks down fairly quickly.<br><br>Does the idea of doing a pie rule with the clocks make the game a bit<br>different and more demanding?  Sure it does, but is it a bad thing? <br>Some might argue it "distracts from the purity of the game".  But<br>adding clocks already does that anyhow.</div>
