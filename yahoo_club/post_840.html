    <div>Just half an hour ago, the mailman gave me "Stein um Stein: Exotik <br>der Brettspiele" ("Stone per Stone: Exotic World of Board Games"), a <br>book published in 1984 in the German Democratic Republic and written <br>by Heinz Machatscheck. It is totally different from his other better <br>known book called "Zug um Zug: Die Zauberwelt der Brettspiele" ("Move <br>per Move: The fascinating World of Board Games"). As I grew up in the <br>American satellite state of Western Germany, I wasn't much exposed to <br>socialist culture and the achievements of the glorious heroes of the <br>Soviet Union ;-). <br><br>Well, I'm serious now, this book is truly fantastic! First reason, I <br>got it for less than 4 Euro, including postage, from a second hand <br>book store close to the German-Polish demarcation line.<br><br>Second reason, the book covers lesser known board games, especially <br>games which are lesser known in non-rogue states. <br><br>The first chapters are about Morris and Draughts variants which are <br>also known in western Europe.<br><br>The "Turmspiel von Hanoi" ("Tower Dame of Hanoi"; not to be confused <br>with the game "Tower of Hanoi" invented by =C9douard Lucas) is a <br>stacking game that is played on an international Draughts board. I <br>haven't seen the game before. The book also gives a sample game.<br><br>This is followed by a very good chapter on Mancala games. Besides <br>many other variants it describes Togus kumalak, probably the best <br>description outside of Central Asia. The game was revived in 1948 <br>when the Soviet of Kasakhstan organized a tournament. Machatscheck <br>gives a game between the masters A. Akshurajew and N. Nurlybajew with <br>many helpful comments.<br><br>The next chapter is about Bashni, the old Russian column checkers. It <br>includes a game played by W. Wiskowitow in Moscow in 1875, again with <br>very good comments.<br><br>The last chapters are not so interesting, but include several games <br>played by Native Americans before they were exterminated by American <br>and Spanish "imperialists".<br><br>The book ...<br><br>Machatscheck, Heinz<br>Stein um Stein, Exotik der Brettspiele<br>Berlin Neues Leben 1984<br><br><br>... is still available at:<br><br>1.<br>Uwe D=F6ring <br>Onlinehandel und Vertrieb<br>Robinienweg 6 <br>D - 06188 Landsberg<br>Telefon (von 8-16 Uhr): +49 (0)34602 / 7 07 97<br>Telefon (=FCbrige Zeiten): +49 (0)34602 / 4 02 62<br>Fax: +49 (0)34602 / 7 07 98<br>E-Mail: u_doering@...<br><br>2.<br>Das etwas andere Antiquariat<br>Bernd Malcherek<br><br>Breite Stra=DFe 36 <br>D - 06449 Aschersleben<br>Telefon/Fax: +49 (0)3473 / 80 26 39<br>E-Mail: dasandere.antiquariat@...<br><br><br>Ralph</div>
