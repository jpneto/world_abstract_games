    <div>Excuse me while a do a little self-promotion.<br><br>Try Rigellan Sii-od.  There's a Zillion implementation at their <br>website.  It's a three-player chess-type game played on a hexagonal <br>field.  The object of the game is not to lose, so right off you're <br>considered playing two hostile opponents<br><br>The movement of each piece is strange but simple, and there are <br>promotion pieces which liven the game without given a player too much <br>of an advantage.<br><br>Someone e-mailed and asked me how I came up with the idea for this <br>game.  Jokingly, I replied, "I forgot to wear my aluminium-foil hat <br>one day."  I was surprised not to hear from them again.</div>
