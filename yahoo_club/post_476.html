    <div>The latest development in the rules of Jade, which <br>I described in some posts awhile back, is the <br>realization that there's a very simple tweak that <br>appears to defeat the symmetry strategy (on odd-order <br>boards) AND provide an adjustable way of balancing <br>the game.<br><br>The game as described previously is played on a <br>"square" grid of hexagons, similar to Hex. (In fact, <br>I think of Jade as a Hex variant.) But the two players, <br>Cross and Parallel, have different objects, and <br>that game seems to tilt fairly strongly toward Cross.<br><br>What I realized in the last month or so is that by changing the board <br>to a more general "rectangle", for example a 9x11 or an 11x13 grid, <br>Cross's advantage will clearly be diminished if not completely <br>erased. This is clear when you consider the "degenerate case" of a <br>board only 1 cell thick: clearly Parallel wins immediately. Even a <br>board just a few cells thick will obviously be Parallel's in a very <br>few moves. Therefore, since we know (or believe, based on experience) <br>that Cross has the advantage on a "square" board, there should be <br>some intermediate shape where the imbalance is minimized.<br><br>I'm hopeful that when we find the ideal size and shape of board it <br>will prove to be balanced enough for most purposes, though experts <br>and other enthusiasts would probably still want to play with some <br>form of swap rule.<br><br>Sometime in the next couple of months I hope to begin a tournament to <br>test some particular size and shape of board. The players will divide <br>into round-robins and every pairing will play two games, reversing <br>their roles. In the end, besides having a winner, we'll have records <br>of how each person fared both as Cross and as Parallel. If the size <br>and shape of board was "balanced," then there should be about the <br>same number of people who did better as Parallel as people who did <br>better as Cross. With a succession of such experiments, we should be <br>able to find an ideal board. Plus, it should be a lot of fun. <br><br>When the tournament details are settled I'll announce it here, in the <br>hope that people will join it.</div>
