    <div>Hey, Rich, the question I have concerns what the abstract-at-base<br>rules give you in higher-level terms. Is there a point that, when<br>passed, takes you out of the realm of abstract game and into the realm<br>of simulation? For example, you could have a large chesimal, with a<br>"skin" consisting of pieces that can cover [attack] every square<br>around them, a "skeleton" of different pieces, "motor" or "muscle"<br>units to move the skeleton and anything attached to it, the brain<br>unit, some attack "organs", say a cannon piece that fires a guard unit<br>5 squares, then the guard can move and capture 2 more squares before<br>it is removed, or a handful of pieces that act as a telescoping spear<br>suitable for attacking a point [like an enemy brain unit], an "organ"<br>that grows pawn "missiles" that shoot straight across the board,<br>removing and being removed by any unit they hit... there's so much you<br>could do with this. And it wouldn't take that much more in the way of<br>rules, maybe another page added to the original 2 pages. So you're<br>using the abstract pieces and chess-like movement rules for each<br>piece, and some additional rules imposing a higher-level order on the<br>pieces, so they mimic amoebas or military units. Does this take a game<br>from abstract to simulation? The additional rules are things like "you<br>must be within 3 of your leader unit to move".</div>
