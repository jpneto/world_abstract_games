    <div>Hello, all.  I'm new to this group, but would like to pass on something I'm working on that would be of interest to abstract gamers.  <br><br>I got it into my head to hold a tournament/competition/event that involved playing several different abstract games in a sort of Decathlong format.  After much thought, I came up with a method to make the contest work, and some proposed ideas.<br><br>I'm in the planning stages now, and would like to announce the contest's existence, and solicit feedback on how we should proceed.  I'll give a brief summary here.<br><br>We will pick 10 abstract strategy games that are playable<br>1. Live<br>2. Free and<br>3. Rated<br><br>at internet sites.  We will play for a period of time, and the goal will be to achieve the highest rating during that time period.  At the end of the time period, we normalize the ratings from each game to achieve a composite score, and declare a winner.<br><br>I've prepared a FAQ at my website that explains things in more detail.<br><br>http://gamesinmichigan.com/decathlon<br><br><br>The major planning discussion is going on in a thread on the boardgamegeek forums.<br><br>http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/442264<br><br>The major topic so far has been whether or not ratings are a good way to decide tournament victory.  While I understand the objections to using ratings, I also have reasons for doing so.  (Summary:  It's a lot easier than any other method.)  However, I am toying with the idea of different formats that would involve more standard tournament play.<br><br>If this sounds like fun to you, stop by my web site or the boardgamegeek thread, add your two cents about how you would like to see things run and, most importantly, what games you would like to see included.
