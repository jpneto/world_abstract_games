    <div>> > I think that the problem is that the new game is "slightly"<br>>different, so in reality it is a different game, has a different name<br>>and can have its copyright. For example Rolit is for 4 players<br><br>You can also play it with two players only,<br><br>and<br>>uses different pieces from Othello. So it is a new game.<br><br><br>There are many different chess pieces, which doesn't make chess a new game.<br><br><br><br>>True, and it's hard to draw a clear, bright line between a trivial<br>>change and one that makes a serious enhancement to play value. For<br>>instance, the fundamental idea of Quoridor can be found in lots of<br>>earlier games, but Quoridor (IMHO)<br><br>Quoridor is a simplified variant of Pinko Pallino made for stupid people (or <br>quoting the producers own<br>words: a game which is not too complicated for ordinary people).<br><br>>On the other hand, does the fixed opening of Othello improve Reversi?<br>>It may possibly reduce the first-player advantage a bit, but is that<br>>enough to call it an "original" game? Of course, the original<br>>inventors of Reversi had been dead for quite awhile before Othello<br>>was published, so the point seems a little academic. I'm glad they<br>>published Othello, because a lot of people have played it who would<br>>never have heard of Reversi.<br><br>In Germany Reversi was always popular. It's a little bit weird a copyright <br>matters as long as the inventor is alive.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br>E-Mails sind zu unpers�nlich?
