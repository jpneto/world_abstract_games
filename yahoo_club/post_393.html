    <div>I'm searching for names and descriptions of board games that utilize a 4x4<br>gridded board. Obviously these will mostly be abstract games. It's<br>surprising that there are a number of games of good depth that work on such<br>a small board. Not surprisingly, there are also some pretty lame ones. The<br>following list shows games I've found so far. I would appreciate knowing of<br>any games I have missed. If possible, I would also like a copy of the game<br>rules or to be pointed to where I can find them, and there are a couple of<br>games already on my list for which I am searching for rules. The last two<br>games on the list are ones of my own design and if anyone else is interested<br>in 4x4 games I will be happy to send them the rule sets for those games.<br>Thanks.<br><br>-Mike Schoessow<br><br>Quarto<br>Farook<br>Dao<br>L-Game<br>Void<br>Foursight<br>Tot-Ten (need rules)<br>Slimetrail<br>Moxie<br>Tic Tac Chec<br>Edges<br>Lucky 13<br>4x4 Micro Chess<br>Gembel (need rules)<br>Score4 (need rules)<br>Tommy's Uchi (need rules)<br>Q-Turn<br>Plateau<br>Catalyst<br>Starplex</div>
