    <div>Hi everyone.  A few years ago I wrote a short piece on "clarity and depth",<br>but it disappeared into the ether when I emailed it.  Here's a brief<br>summary of how these two concepts might be given a mathematical treatment.<br><br>The theory of NP-Completeness in combinatorial computation states, <br>essentially, that most nontrivial combinatorial problems are equivalently<br>complex, in the sense that they are reducible to one another.  After more<br>than 30 years as the outstanding open problem of theoretical computer<br>science, no one has proved, but everyone "believes", these so-called NP<br>(Nondeterministic Polynomial time) problems do not have P (deterministic<br>Polynomial time) general solutions.  I.e. P not= NP.<br><br>Think of an NP problem as a combinatorial game or puzzle where an "Oracle"<br>provides the correct move at every step, and the total number of moves is<br>polynomial in the size of the problem.  Of course the complexity (search<br>space) is exponential, assuming P not= NP.  One can model the computation<br>states of a computer as itself a combinatorial puzzle -- thereby deriving<br>a general, "Complete" combinatorial problem solver for all NP problems.<br>Thusly, one can reduce _any_ NP problem to any known NP-Complete problem.<br><br>One can then look at the general problem solver state transitions (aka<br>computation tree), that ends in a "Satisfying" state (possibly with the<br>help of an Oracle), as providing the certification of a full solution,<br>consisting of a polynomial number of steps.  This is a useful characterization<br>of all NP problems: the solution, once given, can be verified in polynomial<br>time, deterministically, without resort to Oracle -- even if finding a<br>solution in polynomial time had required an Oracle.<br><br>So an NP-Complete problem is both exponentially hard to solve (assuming<br>P not= NP) and polynomially easy to verify once a solution is given.<br><br>This combination of properties translates to game depth and clarity.<br><br>Depth: a measure of the difficulty of coming up with a winning line of play.<br>Clarity: a measure of the ease of verifying a winning line of play.<br><br>As we all appreciate, it is the combination of these two qualities that<br>makes a good game easy to learn yet hard to master.  Clarity enables us<br>to develop pruning strategies for exploring the full depth of the game.<br><br>-- William Chang (Saratoga, CA)</div>
