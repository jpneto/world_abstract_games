    <div>A BRIEF HISTORY OF WAR & GAMES<br><br>Up until modern times, warfare consisted mostly of close quarter combat. True, there were long ranged weapons, such as the bow or musket, the catapult or cannon. But these were seen as supplementing the troops. As late as the Napoleonic Wars, battles were still being decided by the infantry charge. The firearms of the day had a limited range, not to mention were rather slow and inaccurate.<br><br>Games of material capture, such as Chess, Checkers, Tafl, etc - while quite different from one another, along with being abstractions - all have an underlying close quarter sensibility to them. Captures are made by moving ones own piece onto or right next to an enemy piece.<br><br>WWI, RIFLE CHESS, AND THE BIRTH OF THE SHOOTING GAME<br><br>It is difficult for us today to appreciate the profound effect the first World War had on the world. Especially because it has since been eclipsed by WWII. But rapid advancements of technology from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, especially in artillery, meant that when fighting did break out, then the nature of war, both how it was fought and how it was thought about, would be changed forever. Combat was now done by standing back in a bunker and blasting away at an enemy that was on the other end of a field.<br> <br>In 1921, in the aftermath of WWI, W.B. Seabrook considered that Chess should be updated to modern times and invented Rifle Chess. Rifle Chess introduce a new form of capture to Abstract Strategy Games - shooting. With shooting, pieces strike at a distance. The attacking piece does not move. Rather the opponent's piece that it could normally reach is captured and removed from the board.<br><br>The problem with Rifle Chess - as it is with so many other Chess variants - is that Seabrook created an interesting idea (shooting captures) and then simply tacked it onto FIDE Chess with no thought to its overall effect on the game. White has a huge advantage since it is the first that can move it's Queen out into the middle. What usually follows is a mid-game massacre, where pieces on both sides are captured in rapid succession. A typical problem is that there are not enough pieces left to make a viable endgame. Rifle Chess is one of those variants that is usually played more out of a sense of novelty rather than any serious strategic consideration.<br><br>The issue is that shooting alters the nature of the game on a fundamental level. In all other games, a piece has to move in order to capture. This is true even of games with exotic forms of capture, such as Fanorona. But here the piece remains in the same location. Except for the removal of the enemy piece, there is no appreciable change in the board. What is missing is the concept of "exchange" - which is key to so many other games. In the strategy of "exchange" a piece can capture another piece, but only by moving into a more vulnerable position. <br><br>FIXING A FLAW: HIPPOLYTA, TYRANNOS, AND DOUBLE BARREL RIFLE CHESS<br><br>I began to experiment with shooting captures in different ways. One creative approach when faced with a flaw, is, instead of trying to minimize or eliminate it, rather embrace it - magnify it and make it the focus. I took the two deadly Queens from Rifle Chess and filled up the board with them, creating a 64 Queen slaughter-fest. I named it Hippolyta. The rules for it can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/91388?do=3Dshow;id=3D1730<br><br>One element I thought was absent from Rifle Chess is the concept of "cover". Try to imagine a large, extended gunfight where all the combatants are standing out in an open field, fully exposed to one another, trading shots. It seems absurd. People would naturally seek some sort of cover - a wall, a trench, a tree, etc. - to at least partially protect themselves. <br><br>Now it happened that at the same time I was experimenting on shooting games, I was also working on a new Chess variant. In this version, Chess would be played on an Alquerque board. In Alquerque, pieces follow the pattern on the board. So the way a piece a can move and attack - and consequently be attacked from - are determined not so much by the type of piece but rather its location on the board. The game of Smess (aka Take the Brain) had a similar idea. (If anyone is interested, the rules for that game, called Andalusia, can be found here):<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/91378?do=3Dshow;id=3D1733<br><br>So the pieces on the "weak" spaces would at least be shielded from diagonal attacks. Extending this idea of "cover," I also created a Barricade piece. This would act as a sort of movable Block and aid in defense. The slightly larger board would mean the pieces could be more spread out as well. I gave the game an ancient Greek theme and named it Tyrannos. The rules for it can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/91391?do=3Dshow;id=3D1729<br><br>As I was playtesting Tyrannos, I was still struck by the absence of the usually dynamic of attack/counter-attack. Consider that in order to attack another, a piece must first move into the same line of sight as the enemy. However, with the next turn, the opponent will then shoot that piece before the first player has a chance to attack. It occurred to me a simple solution to get around this was to give the players two moves on their turn instead of the traditional one. Here I tried it on Rifle Chess, because that is the oldest and most widely played shooting game. But it is a mechanism that could easily be applied to any shooting game. I called it Double Barrel Rifle Chess. The rules for it can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/91383?do=3Dshow;id=3D1732<br><br>HEAVY ARTILLERY - CANNON AND WHIZ-BANG<br><br>I then became curious to see if there were any other Abstract Strategy Games out there that featured shooting. I found several that had some shooting. For example, the Archer in 3M's Feudal. But shooting was treated as a special maneuver and not really an integral part of the game. The only one that could really be labeled as a "shooting game" was PyroMyth's Cannon. If there are any others, I would be interested in learning about them. The rules for Cannon can be found here:<br><br>http://www.pyromythgames.com/products/cannon/Cannonrules.htm<br><br>In Cannon the power of shooting is offset by limitations on direction and range. This reflect the reality of heavy artillery. While quite deadly, they are also bulky and awkward. The line of three to create a cannon is a similar mechanism to the phalanx in Robert Abbott's Epaminodas. Extending this idea, I created a kind of shooting Epaminodas. I gave the new game a WWI theme. Which I thought was appropriate, considering it was that event that gave rise to the shooting game. I named it Whiz-Bang. The rules for it can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/91394?do=3Dshow;id=3D1731<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>I'm hoping to take the lessons I've learned working on these games and use them to develop new ones in the future. I have a couple of different ideas I'm still playing with. But I also would be interested to see what alternatives other designers can create. Shooting games are a very rare and much overlooked category of Abstract Strategy Games.</div>
