    <div>The Abstract Games Magazine website is still active:<br><br>http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/<br><br>I haven't spoken with Kerry in a while but he assured me that he <br>fully intended to continue the publication of this great magazine.<br><br>If anyone has an outstanding subscription, they might consider <br>requesting a few back issues if they don't have them all.  Or simply <br>wait for the next.<br><br>It is nice to see that there is still much interest in this <br>publication.  It has been a great contribution to the abstract gaming <br>world.<br><br>[There is another installment to "The History of 3D Chess" pending <br>publication which covers the game up through the 1980s.  After that <br>time, the explosion of this form of play is astronomical and may <br>prove difficult to comprehensively cover in a magazine format.]</div>
