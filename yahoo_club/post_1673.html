    <div>I have been busy awhile and I decided to work on the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.  End result is over 25 games that can be played on half a checkerboard.  They are mostly abstract strategy games (over 20), but I also have a press your luck game and a puzzle game (arrange six dice on a board and reduce them down so there is only one die with a six left on it).<br><br>If anyone is interested, you can check this list out on Boardgame Geek.  Here is a short URL to the list of the games, with the rules downloadable also:<br>http://halfcb.caders.com<br><br>Longer version: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/67989/games-in-the-games-on-half-a-checkerboard-series<br><br>For this Series, I am targeting eventually coming out with at least 32 games on half a checkerboard, one for each space.  Over 20 of the games are abstract strategy games.  Games like One Six and 2-5 Skidoo are not.  Other would say that the two Backgammon variants (Frontjammin' and L-Gammon are not either.  So, I set the number at over 20 abstract strategy games.</div>
