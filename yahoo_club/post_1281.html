    <div>Hey Ralf, when you on petty complain sessions, and throw people out of<br>your underscore stacking Yahoo group, because they don't bash Mark<br>Steere, you don't much pity or support.  You tell all your<br>underscorelings to boycott IAGO, because I don't rip Mark a new one? <br>I mean seriously here.<br><br>And you question MY maturity?  Get real.  The reality is, outside of<br>your family, there are likely very few people earth that care about<br>you.  Maybe if you didn't act as such a primadonna MAYBE you would get<br>care, but not now.<br><br>Now, you end up using someone else's email to frag Mark?  Huh?  No one<br>cares Ralf.  Seriously, no one cares.  <br><br>Think that I was in the middle of a strong argument with Mark.  Your<br>SINGLE bit of posting causes that to end.  Think for a minute why it<br>might have.  Maybe if you look in a mirror, you will be able to see<br>what the real problem is with your life.<br><br>How many more forums do you need to be banned from before you end up<br>realizing all your problems in your life come from you.<br><br>And get another email address.  You make a mockery out of what real<br>peace is.<br><br>Anyhow, anyone know what games Ralf has designed?  I can make sure<br>IAGO makes no listing of them.  I don't want Ralf to suddenly sue<br>IAGO, because it happened to do anything with his games.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <peace_panther@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I just received the following Christmas gretings from Mark Steere,<br>> a mentally disturbed person:<br>> <br>> T.E.R.D.‚Äè<br>> From: 	Billy Martini (billymartini@...)<br>> 	Medium riskYou may not know this sender.Mark as safe|Mark as unsafe<br>> Sent: 	Sunday, December 23, 2007 5:28:30 PM<br>> To: 	peace_panther@h...<br>> <br>> Totally Emasculated Repugnant Destiny<br>> <br>> Happy holidays Hermann!!  :D<br>></div>
