    <div>THREE PLAYER GAMES AND THE PETTY DIPLOMACY PROBLEM<br><br>The "Petty Diplomacy" Problem refers to flaw well known to game designers. Three-player games of pure strategy =96 in which there is no random moves or hidden information =96 tend to an inbuilt imbalance. If one player starts to do well, the other two will be forced to team up to eliminate him before taking on each other. Furthermore, when it becomes clear to a player that he cannot win, he can effectively determine the winner by choosing moves that would benefit one opponent over the other.<br> <br>The term "Petty Diplomacy" arises because of the tendency of a player to try to overcome these disparities by attempting to charm and deceive his opponents to his own ends. Rather than playing the game skillfully, the player is endeavoring to win through low-level diplomacy, which is not what a game of pure strategy is supposed to be about. Even when player interaction is effectively eliminated, for example three strangers exchanging moves through e-mail, the imbalance still remains. If one player is perceived to be strong, the other two will tacitly form an alliance against him. When a player realizes he is doomed to lose, he will often be forced to arbitrarily choose between moves that will help one opponent or the other.<br> <br>In other types of three-player games these flaws can be overcome by introducing an element of uncertainty, such as randomness or players keeping certain vital information hidden from each other. In games involving more than three players this usually isn't a problem because the benefit of such a situation is spread out more and there are many more ways for alliances and factions could be divided among the players. However, the imbalance seems inherent in games of perfect information for three-players.<br> <br>FIXING THE FLAW <br><br>Perhaps the imbalance lies not in the fact that it is a three-player game, but because the objectives set out for the players are never balanced to begin with. A great deal of the problem rests in the "last man standing" approach normally used by these games that in many ways invites this kind of flawed play. The typical three-player game is not a single, cohesive game but rather should be seen as a game with a series of distinct stages. Initially, the aim is<br>to eliminate the third player, which makes the two against one scenario inevitable. After that it effectively becomes a two-player battle between unequal forces. As can be seen, the game starts off with two players sharing the exact same objective, forcing their alliance, while the third player is left with the objective to survive as long as possible. By the time it reaches the second stage, the balance that initially existed between the first two players is <br>gone. <br><br>The way to circumvent this is to eliminate the separate stages. Instead of the winner being the last player to reach the objective (staying in the game) the winner should be the first player to reach an objective. Moreover, to avert the formation of harmful alliances, each player's objective needs to be different but equal from the other players'. <br><br>There is still the matter of the "Kingmaker" problem, where it becomes obvious to player that he is losing and he effectively chooses the winner. In order to hamper this, each players' movements must be limited in relationship to one another. This limitation must be meaningful to the overall game in a way that enhances rather than detracts from the strategic considerations. <br><br>THREE PLAYER CHECKERS - FAUSTUS<br><br>The first game I created with the intent of overcoming the "Petty Diplomacy" Problem was "Faustus".: <br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/42480?do=3Dshow;id=3D408<br><br>Before beginning the analysis, I feel I must offer a quick note of explanation. Despite its similarities, Faustus was not based on Christian Freeling's HexDame, although I'd be the first to admit the close resemblance. I had created Faustus quite independently while I was in college during the mid-80's and had not even heard of HexDame until several years ago. What had  happened was I was reading an article on Chess Variants that included a three-player variant along with a passing reference to the "Petty Diplomacy" Problem. It was then the idea for Faustus popped nearly fully formed in my head. Back when I was nine years old I had created another game called Fairy Tale Draughts by combining Checkers with Rock/Paper/Scissors. I would take this basic idea and bring it to whole new level.  I could not think of an elegant way to lay out three players on a checkerboard, so the most sensible solution was to use a hexagonal board. Checkers is well suited to a three-player game. This is because normally  pieces have two separate functions. One is capturing the opponent's pieces. The other is laying traps through compulsory captures and the sacrifice of pieces. In Faustus these two functions are split between a player's opponents.<br> <br>Alliances are still formed, but the game is balanced because the players are forced not to favor an alliance with one opponent over another. Each of the players needs the help of the others in different ways. Furthermore, any alliance can only be temporary because eventually it benefits one player more than the other.<br> <br>Let us say for example that the Wizards and the Devils have teamed up against the Angels. The Wizards sacrifice pieces in order to force the Angels in to more vulnerable positions at which point the Devils move in and capture the Angels' pieces. This benefits the Wizards because it diminishes the threat of the Angels, but it does so at the cost of loss of material. Also, the Wizards have just helped the Devils get closer to their objective, while the Wizards might still need the Angels' help in attacking the Devils. From the Devils' perspective, they are capturing a lot of Angels, but the Angels are the only thing protecting the Devils from the Wizards. Eventually, either the Devils or Wizards will have to break off the alliance because it is no longer to their benefit. Probably one or both will go on to form an alliance with the Angels. The game environment is one of mutual hostility and dependence. <br><br>The game requires players to keep calculating, constantly and carefully, whether to form or break off an alliance. The player must juggle alliances with both of his opponents throughout the game.<br> <br>This addresses the alliance issues, but what of the "Kingmaker" problem?. Due to the skewed relationship of the players and the possibility of multiple captures, I've seen many games where a player who was reduced to a single piece came back to win as well as games where one player had more pieces than the other two sides combined only to be the one to be eliminated. A player's standing in the game can not be reckoned in terms of material alone. The position of the player's pieces, their mobility, their interrelationship to their opponents' pieces, and the phase of the game must all be taken in to consideration. Because of this, it is often not clear until near the very end who will win and who will lose, at which point a player can do little to change the outcome. Even if he wanted to, he'd be limited in his ability to affect one or the other of his opponents.<br> <br>THREE PLAYER MISERE GAMES - CERBERUS<br><br>When I finally got around to the tedious task of programming Faustus I decided the easiest approach was to make it a losing game and then assign the moves to the opposing player. A little while later I realized that simply by taking a three-player game and playing it negatively, one could also overcome the "Petty Diplomacy" problem. Which gave rise to my next attempt, "Cerberus":<br> <br>http://zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/29359?do=3Dshow;id=3D159<br><br>I chose three-player hexagonal losing Chess for a number of reasons. First, because Chess is the most popular attempt at a three-player strategic game. Second, the game used a hexagonal board for the same reasons Faustus did. Third, both Losing Chess and hexagonal Chess had been played and analyzed sufficiently that I could use them as foundation without having to go back and reinvent the wheel. Of the two best versions of HexChess, I chose not to use Wladislaw Ginksi's because it would make the board too crowded. What's more, the pawns in Dave McCooey's HexChess tend to have greater mobility and promote faster, which is usually considered a shortcoming, but in Losing Chess this is something of a virtue. <br><br>Contrary to common sense, the strategy of Losing Chess is not about losing your pieces. Instead, counter-intuitive as it may seem, the most important strategic concept is that there is an advantage in having more pieces than your opponent. Having more material gives you the possibility to surround the opponent with your pieces, gradually restricting him until he runs out of safe moves, and then eliminate your pieces one by one. To restrict your opponent, you would not only need material advantage, but also advantage in mobility and space. All<br>strategic principles arise from this one idea: restricting your opponent, so that he is forced to capture all your pieces. <br>In a three-player game it is difficult for a single player to gain a conspicuous lead since it is nearly impossible for one player to outnumber his opponents. What's more, the factors of mobility and space are limited not only because the board is so crowded but also each player is flanked on two sides. <br><br>The "Kingmaker" problem is hurdled because the measure of player's skill in Losing Chess is his ability to restrict his opponents and force them to capture his pieces.<br><br>THREE PLAYER GAMES ON A SQUARE BOARD - DONUTS<br><br>So far both my attempts had used a hexagonal board because that format easily lends itself to a balanced layout for three players.  I began to wonder if there was an elegant way to set up a three player game on a typical square board.   After experimenting a bit, I realized that a torus would work perfectly.  The donut shape allowed me to place three seperate groups of pieces all equal distance from one another. <br> <br>Working with a toric board put me in mind to another game, Mak-Yek.  A big problem with Mak-Yek is that pieces can easily protect themselves simply by clinging to the edges.  And those pieces in the corners are almost indestructible.  One solution I came up with was to use the edge of the board to complete any captures, in a version I called "Cleave".<br>  <br>A toric board would remove the edges enitrely.  The resulting game I called "Donuts":<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/42474?do=3Dshow;id=3D1689<br><br>"Donuts" still has some of the shortcomings associated with three-payer games.  I started to try some alterations to the rules, such as forced captures.  However I recognized that the fundamental nature of the game changed along with it.  As sometimes happens with game design, the modifications to "improve" it ends up turning the game into a misshapen monster, unrecognizable from the original.  So I restored it back to its basic idea and left it as is, warts and all.<br><br>THIRD PLAYER DISADVANTAGE - TRIDENT<br><br>In the course of playing all these different three player games I discovered another problem that I never heard mentioned before.  In most two player games, the second player is put at a slight disadvantage for moving second.  This disadvantage is compounded even further for the player forced to move third. While I have seen the third player win a number of games, still they have been noticeably fewer wins then either the first or second player.<br><br>The next challenge I gave to myself was to create a three-player game that gave the third player more of an advantage.  Also, all the games I had created before were ones of elimination - involving movement and capture.  I wanted to try and create a different type of three-player game.<br><br>I looked back at some old games to see if any could be modified into a three player version.  One that showed promise was a game I had created for my young nephew to play with his Checkers set.  It was called "Cats & Dogs" and it was a stalemate type gaming involving dropping pieces on the board.  Adding a third player would work well, since all players pieces would be hostile to one another.  Like Cerberus, it would be a misere game.  That is the regular game would be invereted, so the rather than the first player unable to make a move loses, in this version he wins. As play progresses, the board fills up and the player moving last is at a better advantage than the player going first. I called the game "Trident":<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/42480?do=3Dshow;id=3D1691<br><br>AFTERWORD<br><br>Three players abstract games have often been neglected by gamers.  But they are not without potential.  I hope I have created a few games of some interest.</div>
