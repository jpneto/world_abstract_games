    <div>Chessvariants.com will soon be hosting a multivariant Chess variant<br>tournament with the web-based PBM system, Game Courier. The deadline<br>for signing up is March 15, less than two weeks away. Each participant<br>in the tournament will play 6 to 11 games, depending on how many<br>people sign up, chosen from a list of 9 to 14 games. These games were<br>chosen for the tournament by two polls conducted earlier this year and<br>last year. The top 14 games, from which the games in this tournament<br>may be chosen, include 7 classic games described in Pritchard's<br>Encyclopedia of Chess Variants and 7 more recent games. Details on the<br>tournament can be found at:<br><br>http://play.chessvariants.com/tournaments/gamecourier1.html<br><br>You will also be able to sign up from the same page.</div>
