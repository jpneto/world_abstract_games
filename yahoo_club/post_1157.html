I think Rich's idea was to have two separate lists: a list<br>of abstract games in the strictly defined, traditional sense, and a<br>separate list of games which don't really qualify but are "kinda like"<br>abstract games.  I gave Rich the thumbs up on this initially but on<br>second thought I think IAGO would be better without the "kinda likes".<br> Whatever value the kinda-likes have in terms of attracting members<br>and promoting the true abstracts, Backgammon and Kriegspiel are not<br>abstract games and they don't belong in an organization which<br>purportedly concerns itself only with abstract games.  Yes there will<br>be cry babies who want Kriegspiel to be included, and yes Kriegspiel<br>might attract more members but its inclusion damages the credibility<br>of IAGO and promotes a false understanding of what abstract games are,<br>not exactly what you'd expect from an organization that pretends to<br>promote abstract games.  Including Backgammon and Kriegspiel just to<br>accommodate unwarranted complaints would simply be weak, and said<br>weakness would reflect directly onto IAGO.</div>
