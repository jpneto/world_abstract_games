    <div>I think the internet is what enables the increase<br>in abstract games. I have been lurking around<br>abstract game and chess variant sites for the last four<br>years, ever since I finally got a home computer. I<br>believe that the number of people, world-wide, who are<br>actively involved in abstract games are a few hundred at<br>most, with a few more thousand passively interested.<br>Before email and websites and search engines, it would<br>have been nearly impossible for all of us to know of<br>each other and make contact.<br><br>This makes it<br>possible for many game ideas to be disseminated and<br>refined, at little cost in money or time. I think it even<br>makes it more likely for a physical game to be<br>published, because the target market can be readily<br>identified and informed of a game's existence at virtually<br>no monetary cost. Finding an audience for a game,<br>pre-internet, must have been pretty hit or<br>miss.<br><br>Play-by-email is also quick and cheap. A very long time ago, I<br>used to play games by (paper) mail, and found it very<br>frustrating. Here, Zillions plays a big part, because it<br>allows you to play games as a solitary activity. (Let me<br>note here that I much prefer playing over-the-board. I<br>find it difficult to concentrate on an email game, and<br>playing computer programs of any sort just does not feel<br>"real". I find myself making moves just to see what the<br>program will do.)<br><br>I also believe that a major part<br>of the "fun" for many of us is not playing the<br>games, but playing WITH the games. That is, it's more<br>fun to invent and experiment and discuss, than to sit<br>down and concentrate on playing a game frequently<br>enough to play it well.<br><br>I have been accumulating<br>games since the late 1960's, and there were many<br>abstract games published, pre-1990. I just poked my head<br>in my game closet and counted around 25 from before<br>1990 published by "vanity" publishers. I have a few<br>that I have never found mentioned in any games<br>website. Someday, when I get a new computer, with a<br>scanner and digital camera, I will be able to get them<br>posted, so gamers can find out about them, and the<br>inventors get a little more credit.<br><br>John Lawson</div>
