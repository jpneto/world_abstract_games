    <div>I was hoping that someone in this group own or is familiar with the <br>game Duell by Leisure Dynamics Inc. It seems it was also released <br>under the name of TACTIX. I have a set of the rules but they seem to <br>be missing a board diagram.<br><br>The rules state the objective as -" To capture your opponent's key <br>piece or land your key piece on his key space ( Embossed in the <br>board )"<br><br>I would like to know where the key space is located on the board. I <br>would think under the key piece in the starting setup. <br><br>TNX in advance.</div>
