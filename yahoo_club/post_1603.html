    <div>> Thanks for the tip, Matt.  I'll add that book to my list.  I'm working my way though Winning Ways now.  Well, actually just started <br><br>WW is a brilliant book and very entertaining, but it can be quite a slog.  Wolfe has another book which he co-authored with Michael Albert and Richard Nowakowski which is specifically a textbook on CGT.  It's called Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory.<br><br>You might find it worth taking a look.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Matt</div>
