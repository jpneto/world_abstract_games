    <div>> As I pointed out, a row in Gomullo is always a connecton <br>> between two opposite sites at the same time. What was <br>> first, the egg or the hen? <br>> <br>> My solution: <br>> <br>> Gomullo is both at the same time, Connection Game and <br>> N-in-a-Row-Game.<br><br>Using this definition, then Tic-Tac-Toe would also be a connection <br>game, as every winning line connects two sides of the board. I don't <br>know of anyone who considers Tic-Tac-Toe to be a connection game, <br>and am not sure whether this is really a good approach.<br><br>> BTW, I think, "pattern" ist just another expression <br>> for "topology", and territorial games, n-in-a-row <br>> games and connection games should all be called <br>> "pattern-based" or "topological".<br><br>The difference is that patterns are precise placements of pieces in <br>relation to each other, whereas connections are "topologically <br>invariant" in Kerry Handscomb's terms.<br><br>> > Also, Gomullo involves the flipping of pieces surrounded <br>> > in a line (again, a pattern) so it does not really involve<br>> > connective play either.<br>> <br>> The same is true for Troll which also involves the flipping <br>> of pieces surrounded in a line.<br><br>Yes, that's why both Gomullo and Troll are both disqualified from <br>the connective play category.<br><br>> I was surprised to read that the goal of Star should be <br>> something else than to achieve connection(s). In my opinion, <br>> point scoring is just a means to evaluate connections but <br>> not a goal by itself. The goal of Go is still to make <br>> territory or rather territories which are then compared <br>> and measured by a point scoring system. Again, I feel <br>> that you unnecessarily complicate issues by insisting on <br>> (one) "specific" connection as a goal. Point scoring is <br>> never a goal. <br><br>I would say that the goal of Star involves more than just making <br>connections. In all the "pure" connection games, the game ends as <br>soon as one player achieves the necessary connection(s). In Star, <br>the game continues beyond this point regardless of how many <br>connections are made, until the board is full or there is a clear <br>winner - it is the quality of the connection that counts, not the <br>mere fact of connection.<br><br>This is a bit nit-picky, but I belive that it is necessary to take a <br>hard line on this point, otherwise the door is then open for <br>thousands of other games to be included in the "connection game" <br>umbrella, which would weaken the definition greatly.<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron</div>
