    <div>Here then is apparently the first English rendition of the rules to<br>Kavkaz Checkers, except that I may not have it exactly right. Thanks<br>Ralph.<br><br>Kavkaz Checkers. <br><br>Two players (White and Black) have armies of 24 checkers, arranged in<br>all the cells on the first 3 rows of an 8x8 board. White moves first.<br><br>A checker may move without capturing to any of the three<br>forward-adjacent squares (diagonal or orthogonal).<br><br>A checker may capture in any of the eight directions by means of the<br>short jump (jumping over an immediately adjacent enemy checker, to a<br>vacant square just beyond it). Multiple captures are allowed. <br><br>Capturing is obligatory, and a player must choose a move that captures<br>the largest possible number of enemy checkers.<br><br>There is no promotion. Checkers reaching the last row can still<br>capture or be captured, but cannot move otherwise.<br><br>A player loses when it is his turn and he has no legal move. It<br>follows that draws are impossible.<br><br><br>This strikes me as a "standard" checkers variant, the one novel<br>feature (certainly a significant one) being the lack of promotion.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
