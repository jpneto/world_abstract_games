    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>> Maybe they player you<br>> played Mark was expecting you to hit him with a witty, Simon Cowell<br>> style knockdown insult for playing stupid, so they can get a laugh<br>from it.<br>> <br><br>You know, initially I suspected that was the case.  I feared that a<br>few individuals were f'ing with me by pretending to be unbelievably<br>stupid.  Then at some point I was actually hoping they were goofing on<br>me, because the only alternative explanation is pretty bleak.  <br><br>There was a scene in Jacob's Ladder, I believe, where a guy was in a<br>cell in some institution.  He was banging his head over and over again<br>against the window in the door and there was this blood spot on the<br>glass.  I heard later that this was actual footage of some<br>institution.  Not to make fun of the handicapped, but this is what<br>some of these players remind me of.  <br><br>Now I've come to the inescapable conclusion that hoards of mindless<br>people are drawn to online abstract games.  I've seen too many people<br>playing mindlessly, not just against me but against each other.  Like<br>I said earlier, one lady played Dipole 150 times with virtually no<br>understanding of the rules, except perhaps that bigger stacks capture<br>smaller stacks, and she actually won 30 percent of her games.  If you<br>can win 30 percent of your games not knowing the rules, that's a clue.<br> That tells you something about the population.  <br><br>It's disheartening.  Many of them are friendly people who genuinely<br>enjoy what they're doing, but it starts to grate on you.  You play<br>game after game with them, and you can see there's no inclination to<br>actually learn the rules.  Playing against zombies, even if they're<br>happy zombies, is really aggravating.  I hate to be snotty with them<br>but I can't go along with that program.  I have to tell them they need<br>to learn the rules first before we can play again.  Then later, true<br>to their nature, they challenge me again not having learned the rules.</div>
