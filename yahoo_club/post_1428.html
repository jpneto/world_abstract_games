It will be a 5 game event, three of which are straight up<br>abstract strategy games (Hive, Gipf, and Quinamid).  There is also<br>Lost Cities (2 player card game), and Fjords, which is a Euro game<br>with abstract strategy game overtones. It will be taking place in U.K<br>in late May.<br><br>The link to the event is:<br>http://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/twoplayer.php<br><br>For more information on the IAGO World Tour, and the complete 2008<br>IAGO World Tour schedule visit: http://www.IAGOWorldTour.com</div>
