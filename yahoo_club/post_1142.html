    <div>I think the term abstract strategy game need to sub-divided Rich.<br>   <br>  When i talk about games these days the image people get are of family trvia, acting out games, drawing games etc, which there is absolutely fine; but the only other concept people have of game are geeks dressed up in wizard cloaks & grown men playing with soldiers. I think the term abstract strategy is to ethereal - which i find funny because Chess, Draught, Backgammon & card games, to name a few are all, in essence, abstract startegy games. <br>   <br>  My point is that abstract strategy should be sub-divided into games like Chess where there is a goal, there is structure, there is minimal 'illogic-ness in the game play, & games where the board looks 'a pretty pattern,. theres four or five different ways to win & the whole concept seams contrived - like "so & so happens because, err, i cant find a way around it" Do you know what im getting at? <br>   <br>  These are just a couple sub-divisions. The Chess division, for want of a better name, would be classic startegy & the 'so contrived games', they would be abstract stategy.<br>   <br>  What are peoples thought?<br>   <br>  Colin<br><br>Rich Hutnik <docreason@...> wrote:<br>          Thanks.
