    <div>Bill Taylor has generalized my principle (embodied in Atoll) to all<br>hexagonally tessellated boards with 2n perimeter segments.<br><br><br>------- BEGIN CROSS POST --------------<br><br>This is a variant of Mark Steere's new game "Atoll".<br><br>Atoll is played on a board with internal hex-connections, and globally<br>square, divided into 8 equal(-ish) half-sides.  The winning criterion<br>is almost identical to that of "Y", except that the Y criterion is<br>specifically adapted to figures with an ODD number of sides, (Y has 3,<br>but variants with 5, 7 etc are simple).  Atoll, however, is<br>specifically adapted to boards with an EVEN number.<br><br>Mark is to be strongly congratulated on discovering the natural<br>criterion for even-sided boards!<br><br>However, having noticed that, it is perhaps most natural to get away<br>from Atoll's square-shaped board, and move on to the new game, with<br>its globally hex shape, being a natural complement to its local hex<br>connectivity.<br><br>Thus, I propose "HEXATOLL", which is essentially just Atoll played on<br>a hexagonal board.<br><br>Here is the board, with starting regions around the rim:<br><br>| 1               x x o o<br>| 2          o  .  .  .  .  . x<br>| 3        o  .  .  .  .  .  .  x<br>| 4       x  .  .  .  .  .  .  . o<br>| 5     x  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  . o<br>| 6       .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .<br>| 7     o  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  x<br>| 8       o  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  x<br>| 9         x  .  .   .  .  .  .  o<br>| 10         x  .   .  .  .  . o<br>| 11              o  o x x<br><br>(Apologies for the screwy ascii graphics.) Obviously it can generalise<br>to larger boards.<br><br>As before, each player must try to connect one of his own rim regions<br>with a directly opposite one.  As before, there would be a swap (PIE)<br>rule.<br><br>As before, the game is win-loss complementary, and iso-tasking.<br><br>Cheers!
