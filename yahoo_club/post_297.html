    <div>Pagoda is manufactured by a company called Pair-of-Dice Games. They briefly<br>describe the game on their website and have pictures. They also show a link<br>to a review of the game but the link doesn't work for me. I've dealt with<br>these people before (bought a game from them) and they seem very nice. If<br>you e-mail them they may give you an updated link or just attach a copy of<br>the review.<br> <br>Steppe is manufactured by DMR Games and I think I have a paper copy of the<br>rules at home. If you e-mail me ( mschoessow@...<br><mailto:mschoessow@...> ) a fax number I'll try to find the<br>rules and fax them to you tomorrow. <br> <br>I have no information on Domain other than knowing it is a Parker Bros. game<br>from 1983 and seeing a picture of it at abstractstrategy.com.<br> <br>You probably already know this, but Abstract Games magazine has promised<br>articles on all three games in their next issue.<br> <br> <br>-Michael Schoessow<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: truthforum2001 [mailto:Peace_Panther@...]<br>Sent: Monday, September 30, 2002 4:02 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Rules needed<br><br><br>Hello,<br><br>could somebody explain me the rules of Domain, Pagoda and Steppe?
