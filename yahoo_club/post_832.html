    <div>Hi,<br><br>I created a GeekList "Stacking Games" at boardgamegeek.com awhile ago:<br><br>   http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist.php3?action=view&listid=2246<br><br>Perhaps it's useful to see what others generally understand by the term <br>"stacking game" -- one contributor added Jenga :-)<br><br>My understanding is that a "stack" in a stacking game can't be just the <br>physical structure without any function related to the game and its <br>rules. Also, looking at single pieces and there attributes, a stack must <br>have its own attribute set, e.g. maximum height, prominent top position etc.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>   Dieter<br><br><br><br>Ralf Gering schrieb:<br>> <br>>>Well, I also agree.

Some <br>> heterogenous games are not stacking games (e.g. Avante, Shoo). It's not just <br>> the structure which is important -- it's the position relative to each <br>> other!<br>> <br>> BTW, Octi appears to fit this definition, too.
