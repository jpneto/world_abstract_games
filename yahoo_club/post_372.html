    <div>Hello David,<br><br>In terms of weird Hex variants, there's a chance you might enjoy quadrant Hex (http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/quadrant.htm) --- there is a printable 10x10 board, as well as a nice 14x14 GIF provided by Cameron Browne.  I would be happy to play either size via e-mail.<br><br>I would also be willing to play an e-mail game of Mark Thompson's Diagonal Twixt, which we could use an ASCII board for.  (I haven't actually played regular Twixt but I definitely like this variant.)  The GIF of the curved Y board you mention is only 9 points per side --- does anyone know where a GIF of a, say, base-13 curved Y board could be obtained?  If so, I would gladly play Y by e-mail as well.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Steve<br><br>  ----- Original Message ----- <br>  From: twixtplayer <br>  To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com <br>  Sent: Sunday, December 15, 2002 11:25 AM<br>  Subject: [Abstract Games] Twixt and Y: looking for opponents<br><br><br>  Sorry to repost my addiction here, but I hope someone will<br>  be interested:<br><br>  I have several email Twixt games going on PBMserv, but I would<br>  like to play some realtime Twixt. I have Zillions 2.0.<br>  My MSN Messenger handle is twixtplayer@...<br>  My AIM handle is hextwixt<br>  My ICQ handle is 91521647<br>  My email is twixt@...<br>  I could also meet in the IRC DALnet chat room #ZoG<br><br>  If you find the new improved price tag for the new improved<br>  Zillions a bit too steep, there is also a free Twixt jar file<br>  from http://www.twixt.de<br>  It's entirely in German, link removal is not supported,<br>  neither is the pie rule, and you have to download Sun's JRE<br>  (also free) to use it, but it does actually play the game,<br>  albeit poorly. It has Internet connection capability,<br>  although I haven't tested that feature out yet.<br><br>  Another free way to play Twixt or Y is with AIM's image transfer<br>  and a graphics program. It's awkward to say the least, but a<br>  wide variety of games could be played this way.<br>  The idea is, you send an image<br>  of the board back and forth, using the graphics program<br>  to make moves. At least, in Y, pieces are added to the<br>  board but are never removed. So that slightly<br>  reduces the hassle. Here is where you can get a blank board:<br>  http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/the_game_of_y.html<br><br>  We might also try some weird Hex variant. Some blank<br>  board images for that are available here:<br>  http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/pex1.html<br><br>  Eventually I plan to add Y, Hex, and variants to Zillions.<br>  Packages for these already exist, but Y is just plain<br>  triangular Y, and the Hex package is the pits- it takes<br>  forever just to decide if the game is over or<br>  not, after each move.<br><br>  Has anyone here tried AIM image transfer to play a game<br>  (any game) in real time?<br><br>  David<br><br><br>  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br>  abstractgames-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br><br>  Your use of Yahoo!
