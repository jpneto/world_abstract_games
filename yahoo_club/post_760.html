    <div>> According to Stephen Tavener and D. U. Thibault, Foxy (a pseudo-<br>> stacking game designed by Alex Randolph)is played with 11 stones <br>each <br>> color, not with 8 neutral stones (grey) and 12 partial stones <br>(blue, <br>> yellow) as stated by Joao Neto in his "World of Abstract Games".<br><br>The WAG website is a collection of abstract games that can be played <br>with material restrictions, namely, one type of piece (games of <br>soldiers), two types of pieces (games of kings and soldiers) and <br>stackable pieces (games of towers).<br><br>As I mentioned in a previous post here, I'm just concerned with the <br>game specification, not the look, history, colors of the original <br>gameset. Sometimes, I read about a game that does use more material, <br>but can be translated to fit the previous criteria. Foxy is one of <br>those, but there are others. Of course, errors may appear in the <br>translation process, and for those, I'm sorry.<br><br>Cheers, Jo=E3o Neto</div>
