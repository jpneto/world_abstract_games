    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I fully agree with you. Your argumentaion is the only logical one. It <br>comes very close to the definition used in combinatorial game theory <br>which I would take as a starting point and then just drop the <br>requirement that a game has always to be decided by declaring the <br>last player who is able to move the winner.<br><br>> the VERY BEST move. Hence, if two omniscient players were playing <br>> many matches of the same abstract game, and both were trying to <br>win, <br>> then either the first player or the second player would ALWAYS win. <br><br>or the game would end in a draw: This is proven for Oware and Teeko, <br>almost proven for 9-Men's Morris (Ralph Gasser didn't use the <br>official rules of the World Morris Federation) and English Draughts.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
