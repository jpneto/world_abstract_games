    <div>Very interesting board and game.  Looks like two stretched <br>honeycombs superimposed.  Congrats.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, markthomps <no_reply@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> This is to introduce a new connection game, Pentreca, which <br>applies the<br>> concept (from Caeth) of cells claimed by edge-majority, and the <br>concept<br>> (from Trellis) of resolving intersections where four cells meet by<br>> parity (each player "owns" half of such bridges from the start of <br>the<br>> game)to a pentagonal grid. Pentagon + Trellis + Caeth =3D Pentreca.<br>> <br>> I've put a GIF of a board in the Photos section. Two players, Red <br>and<br>> Blue, each having a pen that marks in his color, alternately color <br>in a<br>> single edge with their color. Whenever three edges in any pentagon <br>have<br>> been colored with the same color, that player also colors in the<br>> pentagon. Pentagons in the same color are in the same group if they<br>> share an edge (regardless of whether the edge they share is also <br>colored<br>> with the same color), or if they share a corner of the same color. <br>The<br>> object is to form a group that connects the edges of the board of <br>your<br>> color.<br>> <br>> Mark Thompson<br>> <br>> <br>> <br>> <br>> [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br>></div>
