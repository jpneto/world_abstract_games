The chessvariants.org site<br>> is basically just there; it lets you find it. It accepts pretty much<br>> anything, as long as it's reasonably understandable. <br>> Maybe it's the difference between a society and an organization; one<br>> exists, the other exists with a goal.<br>> Joe<br><br>The CV site is a great reference, and useful.  But it is as about as<br>much of a living and playable form of chess, as a chess glossary is<br>for chess.  What is meant by the Chess of Tomorrow project is to take<br>the CV site one more step and actually get it played in tournament<br>formats, and facilitate the growth of both Chess variants and FIDE<br>itself.  It is to take the best of the best found, and have it finally<br>played and recognized as a legitimate form.  It is also meant provide<br>possible migration paths FIDE chess could take.  In other words, have<br>Chess again be a continually evolving game, with a robust enough<br>framework that it can handle change, and integrate the fullness of<br>experience into the chess world.  The idea here is to ask people to<br>speak on it, and give their two cents towards this.<br><br>Pretty much here, systematize and organize it from a playing<br>perspective so the goals of the variant community are filled greater<br>than they are now.  A simple measure of whether or not things are the<br>way they are now is to ask this: Can you buy variant pieces anywhere<br>on this planet?  I don't mean MAKE your own, but buy your own.  If you<br>are not able to, what does that say about the state of things?  Is<br>Chess Variants supposed to be just some sort of side freak show with<br>no commercial viability so people who are willing to play, will be<br>able to play?  Will it grown enough to be there?</div>
