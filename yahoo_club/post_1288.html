However,<br>"simultaneous move game" has a precise definition which is understood<br>by most English speaking gamers.  It doesn't mean you move at<br>precisely the same time, as Herr Hermann would have you believe.  A<br>simultaneous move game is one in which you commit to a move in secret,<br>hidden from your opponent.  Your opponent does the same - commits to a<br>move in secret - though not necessarily at precisely the same time as<br>you.  Once both of you have each committed to a move, both move<br>decisions are revealed and the moves are carried out, though again,<br>not necessarily at precisely the same time.  After that the cycle<br>begins anew with both players committing to moves in secret.  <br><br>Let's say we're playing Chess and I'm playing White.  I put one finger<br>on my queen and another finger on the square I intend to move to.  Now<br>I'm committed to that move.  I can't take it back.  You study my<br>intended move and in due time you indicate your intended move in like<br>manner.  Then we both make our moves at precisely the same time.  Is<br>Chess now a simultaneous move game?  No.  Chess was and still is a<br>turn based game. But according to Herr Hermann's reasoning, Chess is<br>now a simultaneous move game.  Like I said, "simultaneous move game"<br>has a precise, well established, commonly accepted definition in game<br>theory.  Look it up on google.  It's real simple.  The term is a tad<br>misleading since it doesn't require players to move their pieces at<br>exactly the same time, but that's what game theory provides us with. <br>Unfortunately the term is subject to misinterpretation by non-native<br>English speakers such as Herr Hermann.<br><br>The whole problem leading to Herr Hermann's banishment from SDG was a<br>result of Herr Hermann's extreme arrogance combined with his poor<br>understanding of the English language.  You can see the arrogance in<br>his original post here to Joe.  His initial comment to Joe was "You<br>know nothing."  No "Hi".  No "How are you?".  Just "You know nothing."<br> Nice.  <br><br>When the true definition of "simultaneous move game" was explained to<br>Herr Hermann on SDG, he freaked out and demanded that everyone accept<br>his alternative definition of the term, which nobody did.<br><br>><br>> Maybe Ralf wants to do a<br>> simultaneous game in the Mancala family, but it failed at that.  <br>><br><br>Pretty much.<br><br>> <br>> Well, what I see is that he doesn't know if the game can end in a<br>> repetition position that forces players to cause the game to end <br>> in a draw, although he hopes his play mechanics don't.  I would <br>> say it would be best that this bit of rules is dropped.<br>><br><br>Exactly.  Wishfull thinking masquerading as fact - a cornerstone of<br>Herr Hermann's tomfoolery.</div>
