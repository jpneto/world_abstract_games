    <div>Hi Joao,<br> <br>> > There must be more than 600 Mancala variants and I know the rules <br>> > of at least half of them.<br>> <br>> 600? I had no idea they were so many!! <br><br>Pankhurst recorded more 100 for Ethiopia, Eritrea und Somalia, but <br>there must be more variants played in the Horn of Africa. Townshend <br>gave the rules of almost 100 Mancala games played in the Democratic <br>Republic of Congo alone. Take another 100 in Eastern Africa und 50 <br>each in the South and in Western Africa. Makes 400 in Africa. Mancala <br>is played in many parts of Asia (Mongolia, China, Kasakhstan, <br>Khyrgyzia, India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Ceylon, <br>Maldives, Marianes and even in Iraq). 150 games is probably the lower <br>limit. Let's take another 50 variants in South America and the <br>Caribbean and we get 600 worldwide.<br><br>How many modern variants <br>> (modern meaning less than 100 years) do you guess there are?<br><br>I have the rules of well over 50 games and would guess there are <br>about a hundred games.<br>Several modern games have been invented in Somalia (e.g. Fergen <br>Gobale) and the Congo (e.g. Mangola) during the last century.<br><br>Have fun,<br><br>Ralf</div>
