    <div>> What do you do to prevent an illegal configuration from happening?  It<br>> is possible that someone put down a bishop, multiple pieces, and then<br>> have the only space left is the same color square as the other bishop.<br><br>Right, and rather than delve into all the details I would simply say<br>(as I did) "subject ... to the condition that at least one legal FRC<br>opening setup can be completed from the position." If the first White<br>Bishop is placed on a light square, then any subsequent placement that<br>uses up the last available dark square needed for the other White<br>Bishop would be illegal. Etc.<br><br>If the players find themselves unable to get to a legal opening setup,<br>it follows that some move has got them into this fix, and that move<br>was therefore illegal. I believe the usual Chess tournament rule upon<br>discovering that a previous move was illegal would be to back up to<br>that move and replay it.<br><br>Mark</div>
