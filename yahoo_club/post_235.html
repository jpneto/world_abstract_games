    <div>> Hi Dan and all,<br>> <br>> This sequence can be protracted by the opponent, but not prevented. <br>> The opponent cannot move an Archer to the third row, to block <br>Green's <br>> Archer of the same column, because he would be captured by the <br>> diagonally adjeacent Archer in the next move. The sequence can also <br>> played in a different order.<br>> <br><br>I haven't played the game but I think the problem you are identifying <br>is related to the custodian-capture nature of the game.  Most <br>reconstructions I've seen of Latrunculi/Petteia appear to be easy <br>draws.  As the board thins out you can protect your remaining pieces <br>by clumping them together.  Captures require two moves and can be <br>spotted -- and defended -- fairly easily.  I wonder what types of <br>modifications might salvage these games.  Perhaps two moves per turn, <br>capture by interposition, or allowing the board edge to count as a <br>custodian would help.  Some of these ideas are incorporated into <br>Cleave (by Chris Huntoon), which is available at ZoG and appears <br>reasonably non-drawish.<br><br>Has anybody ever heard Epaminondas referred to as Phalanx?  If I <br>recall correctly Parlett says this.  <br><br>I had the problem of "indestructible forts" in the first version I <br>did of Tunneler (posted to ZoG a few weeks ago).  If you invert the <br>Foremen and the Tunnelers on the first rank, which is how I initially <br>conceived the game, you can dig out the bedrock in such a way that an <br>impenetrable wall is built around the Foremen.  This is pretty much <br>the same problem you identified in Phalanx.  I think I corrected it <br>in the release version, but then again ...<br><br><br>> BTW, where are you from (which country / nation), Dan? Your games <br>are <br>> great and I enjoy them much.<br>> <br><br>Thanks!  I do not get a lot of feedback and appreciate any comments <br>people might have.  I live in Boston now but will be moving soon.</div>
