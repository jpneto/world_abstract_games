    <div>Greetings,<br><br>I read both messages, I appreciate your compliments.  I view it as a <br>4x4x4x4 matrix with the first three dimensions as they are and the <br>4th as a periodic convention (no defined endpoints).  I see the <br>fourth dimension as cyclical, with incremental movement along <br>adjacent quadrants.<br><br>I would love to read your 6D Chess rules.  I see no reason why the <br>Time Vectors game board cannot support more games as in GRYB.  The <br>game board is a basic structure.  I welcome any efforts to brainstorm <br>games using it.  I hope I get a chance to with play them all.<br><br>Kudos back to you and to all abstract gamers out there.<br><br>Best regards,<br>David Barnhart [barneypaloma]<br><br>--- In abstractgames@y..., interrupt27 <no_reply@y...> wrote:<br>> Impressive playing fields!  <br>> <br>> I especially like the GRYB field.  A truly interesting field with <br>> lots of play potential. It got me to thinking of applying Chess to <br>it.<br>> Hmmmmmm...just how to define the moves of the pieces.
