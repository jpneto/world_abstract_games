    <div>>What do YOU, beloved native speaker of English, the holy language of the <br>>most holy King James version, inspired by the Holy Spirit, not by human <br>>failure, think about the following spellings:<br><br>>* Cross-kalah<br><br>>* Space walk<br><br>>* go<br><br>>* Chess<br><br>>* settlers of Catan<br><br>Personally, I'm fine with all of them.  I will comment though that I would <br>expect the last one to be "Settlers of Catan".   However, if the designer <br>intended it to be written that way that's fine with me and it might cause <br>me to to ask some questions.  Those questions, whether answered or not, <br>might even add to the mythology of the game.  For example, I might wonder <br>if the emphasis of the game is based more on its location than its <br>occupants.  On the other hand, I might just write it off as a gimmick.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br>P.S.  Revisiting my example, "TwixtT", I think that particular rendering <br>emphasizes the "connection between towers" aspect of the game.  Some might <br>call it a gimmick, but for me, game appeal can be enhanced to a certain <br>degree by the judicious use of gimmickry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Ralf Gering" <peace_panther@...><br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>08/21/2006 10:40 AM<br>Please respond to abstractgames<br><br> <br>        To:     abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>        cc: <br>        Subject:        [Abstract Games] Re: Spelling games<br><br><br><br><br>> >How do we spell games?<br>><br>>I think it's entirely up to the game designer to specify how the game<br>>should be spelled, and that includes the use of upper and lower case,<br>>hyphens, numbers, and other special symbols.<br><br>Thanks.
