    <div>> Stacking Games should be defined mathematically.<br> ><br>> Definition<br>> A "Stacking Game" is a game which can have >1 pieces at the same place that have different functions depending on their position, thus forming a "functional stack". Each functional stack is an independent one-dimensional unit (bottom - top).<br>> <br>> Examples   <br>> Avalam Bitaka, Bashni, Byte, Dvonn, Emergo, Focus, Lasca, Pasta, Rondell, Stapeldammen, Tricolor.<br><br>Hi,<br><br>as an inventor of stacking games, may I add "Accasta" <br>(http://www.accasta.com) and the variant "Accasta Pari" <br>(http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/accastapari.htm) to your list?<br><br>These games sadly live a very obscure life, they need some attention!<br><br>Also, I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce my very new stacking <br>game "Abande", which I will publish in spring next year. I think I have <br>to extend the testing phase a little bit, but I'm already very satisfied <br>with it. If you're interested in abstract games coming to life email me <br>privately (dieter@...) to join a testing group (we can play <br>over my soon-to-come gaming website - which surely needs some testing <br>too :-).<br><br>Lastly - modestly following the concept by Kris Burm (the Great) - I'm <br>currently working on a third stacking game to end up with a "Stacking <br>Game Trilogy". But expect that in 2007 or later :-)<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>   Dieter</div>
