    <div>Tom,<br><br>I finally got around to reading Schaeffer's book last year, highly <br>recommended.<br><br>Chinook continued to improve as larger and larger end game databases were <br>computed.  From additional online reading, my  understanding is that <br>solving checkers involved both the endgame databases along with new <br>software that searched deeply from the root attempting to reach a position <br>in the database.  Still, there are too many possibilities to perform an <br>exhaustive check, so some form of machine reasoning was employed that <br>involved generalizing the results of obtained from a non-exhaustive <br>search.  That's the part I'm fuzzy on.  I think there is paper associated <br>with this work but I haven't *yet* read it.<br><br>To clarify my earlier point, I don't see computer solution spoiling the <br>game for human competitive play.  In fact, it could even enhance human <br>play.  It may lead to useful insights about the game, but those insights <br>are available to all human players.  For instance, now that C4 is solved, <br>it may be easier to compile an opening book for the game, and if anything, <br>that would have the effect of increasing the sophistication of human game <br>play.  I believe that's what is occurring now with Checkers.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>"Tom Kronenburg" <tom.kronenburg@...> <br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>01/17/2008 11:01 AM<br>Please respond to<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br>To<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>cc<br><br>Subject<br>Re: [Abstract Games] If Connect 4 is "solved" any ideas on what to do to <br>revive it for tournaments?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Greg,<br><br>Although i don't know any<br>If you've read the (very readable) book "*One Jump Ahead: Challenging <br>Human<br>Supremacy in Checkers"* (Written by J. Schaeffer, the dude that solved the<br>game) you'll know how this works. He can explain it way better then me, <br>but<br>i'll give it a try...<br><br>Basically, the proces is the same as in chess, where grandmasters memorize<br>patterns and variation of patterns at the opening and ending phases of<br>games. For instance (although a bit trivial), every chess player knows <br>that<br>a game with White: (2 Rooks, King) v Black (Pawn, King) where the black <br>pawn<br>cannot immidiately promote to Queen status, is always won by white. Hence, <br>a<br>gamepath that will lead to such a situation is a win for white.<br><br>The availability of such data (and not the most trivial kind) can lead to<br>new insights. In checkers, the then reigning world champion Marion Tinsley<br>studied Chinook (the program that solved checkers) games and found some<br>"very excitingnew moves and possibilities." (tinsley) Unfortunately,<br>Tinsley died before Chinook solved checkers. I grand you that you have to<br>have at least master players to take advantage from the availability of <br>such<br>data.<br><br>I don't know enough about Connect-Four, but Victor Allis's original report<br>about solving the game is given at<br>http://www.connectfour.net/Files/connect4.pdf. It is a bit technical - <br>coder<br>speak, but will give you some hints. At around the same time Victor solved<br>Connect-four, it was also solved by James Dow, he said<br><br>"*Many years ago I became interested in Connect-Four. It may seem like a<br>trivial child's game, but that was part of the appeal. I noticed that<br>ordinary people who memorized a few openings or principles could win<br>consistently, even playing against people who were expert at harder games,<br>like chess. As I explored the game my interest increased. I discovered<br>puzzle positions which even a Connect-Four expert wouldn't be able to <br>solve.<br>Eventually I proved by computer that the first player can force a win, but<br>paradoxically when I play against an experienced human, I almost always <br>win<br>moving second, while the opponent sometimes salvages a draw when I move<br>first. "*<br><br>So there you see, the study of solving a game can lead to new insights on<br>gameplay and the value of positions.<br><br>Reviving connect four by altering one of the rules would be hard. As i<br>remember, some variations are solved, but i can't remember this quickly <br>who<br>did it. I think that making certain fields unplayable or making the field<br>infinately large would corrupt the beautifully simple nature of the game.<br><br>Regards, Tom<br><br>On 1/17/08, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I'm having trouble understanding how the fact that a computer solved a<br>> game by computing an immense database of positions has any real bearing <br>on<br>><br>> human competitive play.
