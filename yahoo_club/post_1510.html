    <div>Hi Maurizio,<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "megamau_2000" <madeleo@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I know that I am about 1 year late.<br>> However I would like to point out why I don't agree with you, Mark.<br>> <br>> Even in one of the staples of abstracts (Hex) one of the <br>> players will <br>> receive a more advantageous starting arrangement. <br><br>Yes, this is true.<br><br>> Indeed he will <br>> receive a WINNING starting arrangement (i.e. it will be <br>> the swapper).<br>> <br><br>No, this is not true.  This presumes access to a theoretical super<br>computer which can calculate perfect moves, no matter how large the<br>board.  This doesn't exist.  Yes, one of the players will have the<br>"winning" starting arrangement in the theoretical sense that with<br>perfect play he will win, but perfect play doesn't exist in the real<br>world of players with finite IQs and without astronomically powerful<br>computers.  This perfect play argument is endlessly waged but hasn't<br>the slightest relevance to real world play.<br><br>> In ALL games which are not theoretically drawn,the advantage <br>> will be <br>> decided by elements outside the games (i.e. the pairing and <br>> color choosing mechanism) which are often random. <br><br>Yes, which elements are *always* random - unless you say the the older<br>of the two players goes first or the taller player, etc.  This is<br>still random in a sense though.<br> <br>> If you want to neutralize this effect you will have to play <br>> 2 games, <br>> one with black and one with white.<br><br>Yes, if you want to *completely* neutralize this effect to absolute<br>zero, you need to play two games.  But . . . this isn't necessary. <br>It's only necessary to *minimize* this effect to the point of being<br>insignificant.  You essentially increase the board size, in a totally<br>scalable game like Hex for example, to match the skill levels of the<br>players.  Beginners can play a sufficiently equitable game on a 7x7. <br>The most expert Hex players can enjoy a nearly perfectly equitable<br>game on a 100x100 board (for example, though it shouldn't have to be<br>nearly this large) using the pie rule.  Any theoretical move order<br>advantage on a board this size would be utterly insignificant.  In<br>fact it would be effectively zero, completely overwhelmed by such<br>factors as tiredness, distraction, skill difference on that day of the<br>week, round-off error in computers with limited power, etc. <br><br>> <br>> So, would you consider abstract a game defined as the sum of two <br>> Chess960 games with swapped colors ?<br><br>No, I really wouldn't.  I think this double game business is baloney,<br>just on aesthetic grounds.  It ruins a game like Hex which normally<br>can't be drawn, and it's totally unnecessary for high quality,<br>scalable games such as Hex, but not including Chess, as previously<br>outlined.<br><br>I may be taking a long break from game design and the Internet (except<br>email) but I'm winding up the current games I'm playing and answering<br>posts such as this one for a few days at least.<br><br>I'm not real good at moderating or multitasking.
