    <div>I'm not sure what to make of simultaneous games.  The first one I found <br>out about was "Pulling Strings" by Clark Rodeffer.  Certainly original, <br>interesting, and well thought of, but regarding simultaneous games in <br>general, there seems to be kind of a poker like, "mind reading" <br>element, where it helps to know your opponent and what he might likely <br>do.  Of course I suppose that's true in all games to some extent.  <br><br>I don't want to insult simultaneous games and say they're less pure <br>than sequential games, but suffice to say that in general the notion of <br>simultaneous moves doesn't hold an immediate appeal for me.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Dieter Stein <dieter@s...> wrote:<br>><br>> > cannot be avoided in normal perfect information games [is Ricochet <br>Robot <br>> > a perfect information game?
