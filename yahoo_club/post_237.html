    <div>> Sorry, but you are totally missing the problem.<<br><br>Since when do you define the problem?<br><br><The draw is simply <br>> related to the early creation of a safe position, that is, a <br>position <br>> in which no piece can be captured and one piece can freely move<br>back <br>> and forth. <br><br>And is this problem not related to the diffculty of accomplishing <br>custodian capture?<br><br>>This is the same mechanism as in Halma (whether played <br>> with Wayne Schmittberger's rule change or not, doesn't matter) and <br>in <br>> Halma you don't capture at all. The same can happen <br>(theoretically)in <br>> games in which you capture by leaping over opponent's pieces. It is <br>> (theoretically) possible in all games in which <br>> <br>> 1. you don't capture by replacement (or not at all) <br>> 2. pieces are permitted to move from one board position to another<br>> 3. pieces may move to the side and/or backwards <br>> 4. capturing isn't compulsory<br>> <br><br>That was the point of my mentioning "impenetrable forts."  Did you <br>miss that part?<br><br>> > Perhaps two moves per turn, <br>> > capture by interposition, or allowing the board edge to count as<br>a <br>> > custodian would help.  Some of these ideas are incorporated into <br>> > Cleave (by Chris Huntoon), which is available at ZoG and appears <br>> > reasonably non-drawish.<br>> <br>> Again you miss the point and that's the reason that you come to <br>these <br>> strange conclusions.<br><br>What in the world is strange about these conclusions?  Do you dispute <br>that capture by intervention or by use of board edge decreases the <br>likelihood of draws, all other things being equal? <br><br>>The initial position of Cleave is already a draw <br>> and, to say it frankly, the most primitive which can be imagined. <br>You <br>> could even offer a draw before you make your first move!!! The game <br>> is an embarrassing flaw. <br><br>Point well taken.  It is an embarrassing flaw.<br><br>> <br>> Phalanx is not another name for Epaminondas, but the term for the <br>> special way of moving around in Epaminondas and in clones such as <br>> Freeling's Bushka.<br>> <br><br>Let me quote Parlett's discussion of Epaminondas:  "I believe it was <br>later renamed Phalanx."  I remain curious if anybody has any <br>information regarding this.</div>
