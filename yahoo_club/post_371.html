    <div>Sorry to repost my addiction here, but I hope someone will<br>be interested:<br><br>I have several email Twixt games going on PBMserv, but I would<br>like to play some realtime Twixt. I have Zillions 2.0.<br>My MSN Messenger handle is twixtplayer@...<br>My AIM handle is hextwixt<br>My ICQ handle is 91521647<br>My email is twixt@...<br>I could also meet in the IRC DALnet chat room #ZoG<br><br>If you find the new improved price tag for the new improved<br>Zillions a bit too steep, there is also a free Twixt jar file<br>from http://www.twixt.de<br>It's entirely in German, link removal is not supported,<br>neither is the pie rule, and you have to download Sun's JRE<br>(also free) to use it, but it does actually play the game,<br>albeit poorly. It has Internet connection capability,<br>although I haven't tested that feature out yet.<br><br>Another free way to play Twixt or Y is with AIM's image transfer<br>and a graphics program. It's awkward to say the least, but a<br>wide variety of games could be played this way.<br>The idea is, you send an image<br>of the board back and forth, using the graphics program<br>to make moves. At least, in Y, pieces are added to the<br>board but are never removed. So that slightly<br>reduces the hassle. Here is where you can get a blank board:<br>http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/the_game_of_y.html<br><br>We might also try some weird Hex variant. Some blank<br>board images for that are available here:<br>http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/pex1.html<br><br>Eventually I plan to add Y, Hex, and variants to Zillions.<br>Packages for these already exist, but Y is just plain<br>triangular Y, and the Hex package is the pits- it takes<br>forever just to decide if the game is over or<br>not, after each move.<br><br>Has anyone here tried AIM image transfer to play a game<br>(any game) in real time?<br><br>David</div>
