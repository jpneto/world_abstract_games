    <div>Yesterday a new Salta Club was started on Yahoo! Groups. Salta is an abstract strategy game, which was very popular in the first decade of the 19th century. <br><br>Most of the early literature about this game was in German, French or English. Copies will be added to the club's library (files section). The group can also be used for discussions about other games of the Halma family.<br><br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/Salta-Club/<br><br>Take a look!<br><br>Ralf<br><br>=</div>
