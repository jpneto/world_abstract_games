    <div>Mark Thomps writes:<br>> Trans America I haven't played, but it sounds<br>> like some kind of geography trivia game.<br><br>It's actually a railroad building game.  I don't think of it as abstract (in the way that, say, Flexx is), but...<br><br>The board is a hex-grid map of the US, with about 50 cities divided into five regions (N, E, S, W, and central).  For each city there's a card.  Most grid lines require only one 'unit' to lay track on, but those crossing mountains or rivers take two.<br><br>At the start of each round, everyone draws one card of each region (5 total).  Your city cards are hidden from the rest of the players.  You then place a token on the board for your hub.  On a turn you lay down two track units along the grid lines (ie, two normal lines or one mountain/river crossing line), but the track you lay down must be reachable via track from your hub.  All track is "global", so if you connect to another player's track, you can extend from theirs (and vice versa).<br><br>The goal is to be the first to connect all five of your cities.  When someone gets all their cities connected, the round ends.  Everyone scores -1 points for each step away from getting all five connected (from a starting total of 12).  Game ends when someone hits zero (and loses).<br><br>I've played it a lot in a 2-player setting, and find the standard rules to be... ineffective.  Unless you're extremely unlucky in your draw, rounds tend to end with the loser losing only one or two points -- a close (but unexciting) game the whole time.  It's a little more exciting with more players (or if the players are all fairly clueless), but not by much.  Pretty much the only tricks are where to start, when to connect, and what paths to take across tricky areas... but all of those can be quickly learned in just a few games.  Aside from that, it's all luck of the draw in order to win that point or two.<br><br>The 2-player rules I've adopted are: everyone draws nine cards, regardless of region, face down (so you can only see the region, not the city).  Then, each person draws one more card.  If they already have cards from all five regions, they can choose any card, but if they're missing any region, they have to draw one of those.  (if more than one region isn't represented, I guess they can pick the region -- it's yet to happen to me)<br><br>This makes for a more dynamic game, as one player might be focused on the west coast, the other on the south.  It seems to make it a much more strategic game as well.  Your choice of starting point is much more important (and often gives information away).<br><br>Anyway, just my $2. ;-)  Haven't played any of the other four games, though.<br><br>Merle</div>
