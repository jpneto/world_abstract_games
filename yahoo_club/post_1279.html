    <div>You can avoid losing by splitting one of your stacks into two of your <br>own stacks. Your opponent can't capture two of your stacks in one <br>turn. The only way you can't split one of your stacks into two of <br>your own stacks is when your last remaining stack has only one of your <br>checkers in it. In test playing, it seemed fairly easy to avoid that <br>situation. <br>Splitting stacks this way is clearly not sustainable unless you also<br>recapture a mixed stack with your split stack.   I agree with you that<br>death stacks does not clearly progress toward an endgame, but that doesn't<br>necessarily make it a fatally flawed game.   Consider Shogi, where captured<br>pieces are continuously reintroduced into play.<br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
