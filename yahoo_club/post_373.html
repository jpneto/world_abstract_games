    <div>> The GIF of the curved Y board you mention is only 9 points per<br>>side --- does anyone know where a GIF of a, say, base-13 curved Y<br>>board could be obtained?  <br><br>In the Photos section, there are now 3 Y-boards. They're <br>topologically correct, I think, but the projection isn't quite <br>perfect -- on the largest board you can see where the midpoint of <br>each side isn't far enough out. Perhaps someone else will add some <br>kind of move notation.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br>Chicago, IL</div>
