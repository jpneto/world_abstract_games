    <div>Shoo is decribed at:<br><br>http://www.nrich.maths.org.uk/mathsf/journalf/jul99/game1/<br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/shoo.htm<br><br><br>My Review:<br><br>My first impression was that the rules of the game are rather<br>complicated, not very elegant. <br><br>Unpromoted pieces called "foot travellers" (ie pieces not mounted on a<br>horse) can be forced to move, which is called "shooing" or taken off<br>the board which is called "shooing off". "Shooing off" means actually<br>to capture travellers of the opponent, although they can be reinserted<br>by him in a later turn. Your "foot traveller" is "shooed" or "shooed<br>off" by any two pieces of your opponent (foot travellers and/or horse<br>travellers) diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to it. A horse<br>traveller cannot be shooed. Moving into a position where your own foot<br>traveller can be shooed or shooed off is basically illegal as it can<br>be punished by "hushing", a primitive childish rule derived from<br>Draughts (but not used by expert players).   <br><br>The reason why "shooing" was added to the rules is explained by Joao<br>Neto as follows:<br><br>"Shoo is the mechanism to avoid the drawish tactic of keeping<br>one or more travelers (sic!) inside its own home base."<br><br>Well, this statement must be changed to "inside his opponent's home<br>area (so that the opponent can't fill it)."<br><br>This statement illustrates the rather superficial understanding of<br>those who invented the game. It is nonsense because a few moves are<br>sufficient to reach a drawn position. A player only needs to promote<br>his traveller at the corner which is closest to the center of the<br>board, move one traveller out of the home area, close the wall again<br>and then move with one traveller inside the wall back and forth. No <br>traveller of the wall can ever be shooed because every advancing piece<br>of the opponent would be immediately hushed.<br><br><br>A drawn position for Blue (lower right corner):<br><br><br>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..<br>.. .. .. .. .. ..
