This means that I can <br>provide you with completely free, standalone versions of Dipole, <br>Quadrature, and Tanbo.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br>>  Looking at the GamesByEmail Dipole program for example, every<br>> opportunity for innovation has been seized.  Everything that can be<br>> optimized has been optimized.  Let me run through a few items.<br>> <br>> 1. The board colors are muted and the pieces are large, bright, and<br>> clearly labeled.  Great start.<br>> 2. You click on a stack and drag a translucent piece around.  When <br>it<br>> approaches a legal square, it snaps to center, becomes opaque, and<br>> displays the stack size.   *And* simultaneously the original stack<br>> size is adjusted.  All this before releasing the mouse button.  <br>Nobody<br>> else has that. <br>> <br>> 3. Moving a stack off the board - more innovation.  You move the <br>stack<br>> to a square just outside the board and "+" and "-" buttons appear <br>so<br>> you can adjust the number of pieces you want to move off.  Again,<br>> nobody else has that.  All the other Dipole programs give you a <br>list<br>> of stack sizes to select from.  Scott's technique significantly<br>> reduces the amount of screen real estate required, as well as the<br>> distance you have to move the mouse.<br>> <br>> 4. The artfulness.  While the board and pieces are almost <br>completely<br>> two dimensional appearing, Scott put some texture and shading onto <br>the<br>> pieces in a way that doesn't impair the clarity or visibility of <br>the<br>> board or pieces.<br>> <br>> 5. Etc., etc., etc.<br>> <br>> It's the level of quality.  You return to your room at at the <br>Naples<br>> Ritz-Carlton after an awesome dining experience at their <br>restaurant,<br>> and the bed is turned down with a mint on the pillow.  Every minute<br>> detail has been attended to.<br>> <br>> No offense to you or others who have programmed my games.  I<br>> appreciate all the good work done.  It's just that Scott deserves<br>> kudos for advancing the state of the art, or to put it another way,<br>> elevated the quality of the user interface to new heights.<br>> <br>> Mark<br>> <br>> --- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@> <br>wrote:<br>> ><br>> > Hi Mark,<br>> > <br>> > I'd be interested in knowing more about your comment.
