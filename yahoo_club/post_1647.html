    <div>The biggest factor IMO is luck.  Oust, now widely considered to be my best game, *totally* stagnated for its first 2-1/2 years.  People felt it was too complicated.  I considered removing it from my website for that very reason.  Then Oust was "discovered" by Daniel Savarese and programmed for his real time game site, IGFIP (http://www.igfip.com/).  A couple months passed before I even knew it was there.  After playing several games of Oust with Daniel, I became infatuated with its gameplay, and then I discovered its unique draw position, a board filled with a checkerboard pattern of stones.  At that point I switched Oust over to a hex hex board, where that couldn't happen, and I did remove square Oust from my website.  Later I put it back on when I realized how foolish that was.  Arty Sandler picked up both versions of Oust (IGGC - http://www.iggamecenter.com/) and the rest is history in the making.<br><br>I should mention that Aaron Dalton was the first to program Oust for his game site, SDG (http://superdupergames.org/).  SDG is a turn based site and square Oust was originally programmed with a 19x19 board, as originally specified, though SDG now has 11x11 too.  Because of stone recycling in Oust, 19x19 turns out to be way too big, especially for a turn based site, so it never really took off there.  Now that the 11x11 has been added to SDG though, it's only a matter of time.  <br><br>Cage is also on SDG now and I've got open challenges posted for Cage and Oust.  SDG is fully cellphone compliant, which explains why I'm always playing with my phone at restaurants, theaters, etc.</div>
