    <div>I tried some of the variants. They all appear very interesting.<br><br>> [Gomoku] <br>> <br>> Give each player just 12 stones<br><br>Do you have a name for it? The transition between 1rst and the 2nd <br>phase appears to be rather difficult. <br><br><br>> Hide<br><br>I tried it on a 12x8 board (12 wide, 8 deep). This appears to be a <br>good change.<br><br>> Apparently, there is a game called French Checkers<br><br>I doubt that the game really exist. Probably somebody heard that in <br>France (that is, in International Checkers) men captures backward and <br>s/he then tried to play the game with faulty rules calling it "French <br>Checkers". <br><br>Thanks again for sharing these games with us,<br><br>TruthForum</div>
