    <div>> if you move the largest gobblet again, will you <br>not uncover the smaller one beneath ?<br><br>Is that a genuine, as opposed to a rhetorical, <br>question? Anyway I think the answer is yes. I <br>can't make the link to the pdf work right now, <br>but I'm certain I remember seeing in the rules <br>(back when I could get at them) that moving a <br>gobblet uncovers any smaller ones it has <br>captured.<br><br>As a digression, this introduces the element of <br>"memory" into the game: you have to remember what's <br>under the pieces you can see. Technically that <br>doesn't disqualify it as an abstract game, but I feel that in keeping <br>with the "spirit" of abstract-gameness, one should be allowed to peek <br>under the top gobblet(s). It would be even better, IMO, if the <br>gobblets were topless so one could simply see what pieces they cover. <br>Similarly, I feel one should be allowed to count stones in a mancala <br>pit, even if you have to touch them.</div>
