    <div>All three are Laska variants.  Poking around on newsgroups<br>dug up these links:<br><br>Pasta was invented in 1956 by Alvin Paster. This link also<br>includes the rules for Laska: <http://snurl.com/11g5><br><br>Gomony was invented by Harvey Klein.  Its only difference from<br>Laska is being played on an 8x8 (vs 7x7) board, and having the<br>unpromoted and kinged pieces marked on the side. Klein says it<br>here in his own words: <http://snurl.com/11g7><br><br>According to someone in Holland, Stapeldammen is dutch for<br>"Russian Draughts" also known as "Shaski". Shaski may or may<br>not be Stapeldamman.<br>Shaski rules: <http://snurl.com/11g8><br>Stapeldamman description: <http://snurl.com/11g9><br>Its seems to have been invented in the 1960's.<br><br>From this German website on Laska is more info.<br><http://snurl.com/11ga>  <br>A web-bot translation as follows:<br><br>"Laska" belongs to the group of the column or tower plays<br>(English "column games").  It is common to this family of<br>board plays that the opponent removed Spielsteine are jumped<br>over, taken not however by the board.  In such a way <br>conquered and/or caught Spielsteine to columns and/or to<br>towers are stacked.  The oldest of these column plays is<br>followed Baschni "(also called" Bashne") ", of "Laska".  <br>1956 followed with "Pasta" the third column play, 1965 with<br>"focus" (also under the names "Domination" or "stack" well-known)<br>fourth, end of the 1960er years with<br>"Stapeldammen" the fifth.  Center of the 1980er years were<br>added "Emergo" and "HexEmergo".  For years the family of the<br>column plays became larger the 1990er around at least five<br>further representatives ("Baschni per ", "Gomony", "plateau", "Topper"<br>and its variants, "Tumbling down").<br><br>And finally Jo=E3o Pedro Neto has an excellent web page on<br>abstract games.  Check out the link to "Games of Towers" for<br>more stacking games.<br><http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/index.htm><br><br>Hope this helps you out.<br><br>--Ken Rice</div>
