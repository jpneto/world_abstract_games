    <div>Not to be a nitpicker, Maurizio, but Star and especially Fire and Ice <br>seem to share Hex's vulnerability to first move advantage.  Pylos - and <br>I have only read a brief description - but the fact that you can put <br>one ball on and immediately take one or two off - I am not yet <br>convinced that this game is finite.<br><br>Your point that no game is perfect is well taken.  But I reiterate that <br>some games are more resistant to first move advantage than others.<br><br>Mark</div>
