    <div>Once it is worked out, It will have the IAGO Standard version<br>Chess960.  The object is to find out the best way to have black and<br>white place pieces down to get an official Chess960 layout, with<br>randomization.  There is issues of how many pieces each side should<br>place down, and is there an order, like rooks first, then bishops or how?<br><br>Please comment on the best way to do this...<br>- Rich</div>
