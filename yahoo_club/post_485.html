    <div>> By the way, the first player has a terrific advantage in Blokus, the<br>> second player somewhat less so.  My game group Seattle Cosmic tends <br>to<br>> handicap the first and second players by only letting them play <br>small<br>> pieces (fewer squares) on the first turn.  That way the early <br>players<br>> don't gallop to the center ahead of everyone else and dominate the<br>> board unfairly.<br><br>That's interesting, and the kind of thing game companies don't <br>usually put into their rules. Which pieces do you allow for the first <br>and second players, anything smaller than a pentomino? or is it <br>stricter still?</div>
