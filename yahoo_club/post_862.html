    <div>I received today two more defamatory mails from Mark Steere which <br>were sent thru this group to my private e-mail account. <br>Yahoo!Germany  and Yahoo!USA have been informed. I demand to remove <br>all harrassing, racist and anti-Semitic posts from this list <br>immediately. Otherwise it could happen that Yahoo will shut down this <br>group. Mark Steere has lost his email account at Hotmail yesterday, <br>but (be informed) used a new Hotmail account to send me another <br>criminal e-mail just some hours ago. It could be proved that this <br>anonymous e-mail was sent from his computer. Walter Sandsquish, the <br>owner of the group "stacking-games", has also started to send me <br>harrassing emails and still supports Mark Steere. Not a single word <br>of excuse. I think Hotmail will soon ask the police to start an <br>investigation against Mark Steere because of his stubborn abuse of <br>their service. I also asked a Jewish friend who lives in Israel for <br>advice. I think that calling someone a Nazi just because you don't <br>like Germans, is to belittle the terrible murder of millions of <br>Jewish children, women and men. This is anti-Semitic! <br><br>I doubt that Mark Steere should be a member of this group.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Ralf Gering<br><br><br><br>Von:  Mark Steere <marksteere@...> <br>Gesendet:  Dienstag, 29.

Hope all is well.  Is it true that you were exiled <br>by your own embarassment?  I hope not.  That would be a pitiful waste <br>if it were true - three years down the drain and all. <br><br>Oh well, look at the bright side.  You'll always have your mommy to <br>play with. <br><br>Do you really despise game inventors?  I don't understand why you <br>would since you seem to enjoy their games.  Go figure. <br><br>Anyway, good luck in all your endeavors.  We're certainly going to <br>miss you.</div>
