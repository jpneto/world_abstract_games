    <div>My comment to:<br><br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/kuba.htm<br><br>> KO rule - If a player push a set of stones, with an opponent stone <br>> at the end, the next player cannot slide back on that row/column. <br>> He must wait for the turn after.<br><br>This is not the official rule.<br><br>For instance:<br><br>--> 0XX at the edge of the board<br><br>White pushes one black stone off the board.<br>Black may push back, because the position isn't repeated.<br><br>For instance:<br><br>--> 0X.X<br><br>White pushes on black stone to the right. <br>Black pushes one black stone and one white stone to the left.<br><br>The exact rule is as follows:<br><br>If a player pushes stones in one direction, the other player may not <br>push these stones back in the opposite direction in his next move if <br>the full board position is repeated, but must wait one turn.<br><br>Still, this rule isn't perfect as there are full board repetitions <br>after 4 moves.<br><br>It would be best if the rule would simply be:<br><br>It's not permitted to repeat a full board position during a game.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
