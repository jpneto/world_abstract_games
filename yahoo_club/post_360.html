    <div>Desertion is a fascinating modern Draughts variant invented by <br>Professor Dr. Trevor Truran, an Englishman born in 1942 during an air <br>raid. (that's about all I know about him)<br><br>The game can be played on a board with 8x10 checkered squares <br>(actually it is played on a board with intersections and lines). The <br>double corner must be on the right side of each player. Each player <br>has 12 pieces, which are initially filling the first three rows of <br>each player.<br><br>The men move diagonally forwards as in English Draughts.<br>They capture exactly in the same way as in English Draughts. <br>Capturing is compulsory. I suggest to play without huffing. (there <br>are special rules, but they are childish and expert players don't use <br>them anymore in Draughts). However, pieces which you have captured <br>are not removed from the board but replaced by pieces of your own <br>color. <br><br>If you reach the last row of the board, you take your piece off the <br>board. In the next move you must put this piece on the board again, <br>on any unoccupied square of your first row. If you can't do that <br>because all squares are occupied then do another move.<br><br>Putting your piece back on the board takes precedence even over <br>capturing. It counts as a full move.<br><br>Draws are impossible. The player who moves last wins. A player who <br>can't move loses.<br><br>The game is reminiscent of Gorgon (which should be played with <br>compulsory capturing in spite of the inventor's opinion that you <br>should not)<br><br>There are only very few Draughts variants which cannot be drawn:<br><br>Sleeping Beauty Draughts (to be described in AG13), Kavkaz Dama, <br>Gorgon and Desertion.</div>
