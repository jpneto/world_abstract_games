    <div>The SPAM problem in this last month was terrible. Because of that, <br>I've changed the membership status. Now I must accept each individual <br>new entry. Let's hope this keep things more controlled. Eventually, <br>there are some bots already inside, but I'll delete them as soon as <br>they post trash.<br><br>Cheers, Joao</div>
