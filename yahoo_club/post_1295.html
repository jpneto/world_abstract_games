    <div>Yes, you did use that term.  You called your game a "simultaneous move<br>game" in an early incarnation (one of many) of your rule sheet.  Are<br>you actually going to deny that here?<br><br>When I told you your game wasn't a simultaneous move game in response<br>to your claim that it was, you said I was wrong, as is clearly<br>evidenced in the thread that YOU PROVIDE HERE.  And then of course you<br>removed that term from your rule sheet.  <br><br>And now you can't even answer the central question that kicked off<br>this whole debate.  Is your game a simultaneous move game or not?<br><br>[see Hermann continue to squirm]<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <peace_panther@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Just as I said I never used this term.
