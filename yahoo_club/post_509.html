    <div>> Does anyone know how many pieces do the players <br>> have? I have found several articles and the <br>> number is different. Some say 3 and some say 4. <br>> Which humber is correct?<br><br>I find a discussion of this game at <br>http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/~museum/rowgames/tapatan.html<br><br>That site says there are versions of this game that have been played <br>for a long time in many places, some using three pieces and others <br>using four, and with other minor variations in the rules. So I <br>suppose there's no definitive answer, unless someone wants to argue <br>that one version is definitely better than others and deserves to <br>become the standard.</div>
