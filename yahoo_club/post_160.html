    <div>Hi Ji!<br><br>> In this game it is obviously not good to win by too much for it  <br>> reduce one's own score. And worse if you lose. So when has to <br>> strive for an almost tie where one is on top.<br><br>Well, even if the almost tie can get you most points, I don't <br>think it would be used, for two reasons:<br><br>(1) Except for the perfect player who would perfectly knows what is <br>going on, a winning player would not start to "loose a bit", because <br>it would risk his own victory, and,<br><br>(2) The loosing player would not go with that. After the future <br>defeat is seen, the looser would try to loose as badly as he can <br>(considering that the game is not a zero-sum game, and if it is, this <br>meta-rule makes no sense). Imagine Scrabble, the looser would start <br>to make as few points as he can, trapping himself with lots of <br>unusable letters.<br><br>Both players would play normally, until the victory-defeat horizon is <br>seen. After that, and taking these two points, the behaviour of the <br>loosing player would fasten his own end, a kind of twisted min-max<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao</div>
