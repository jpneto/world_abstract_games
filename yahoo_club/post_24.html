    <div>I been fiddling around with several ideas that I<br>think is beginning to gel as a game.<br>The game should<br>start on a suitably large board. Go-board should be<br>sufficient. <br>Though I haven't worked out the details<br>yet.<br>First the rules for the turns:<br>1. Each turn consist<br>of an optional move and an required placement.<br><br>The option to move can only be invoked if one of the<br>pieces owned <br>by the player who has the turn is<br>threatened. Which piece owned by that player <br>is moved<br>however is not restricted.<br>2. Each piece can move<br>exactly as far orthogonally as there are pieces around it<br><br>regardless who those pieces belongs to.<br>3. A piece (other<br>than the first piece) can only be placed within or on<br>a five by five <br>box centering on an existing<br>piece. For the first placement, it is arbitrary.<br>4. A<br>capture is made when a move takes a piece onto a spot<br>occupied by its opponent. <br>captured piece is returned<br>to the owner of the piece.<br>Object:<br>To capture<br>a set amount of the opponent's stones. Experienced<br>player can be hadicapped <br>against weaker players by<br>changing the number of pieces each side need to win,<br><br>say 5 for an experienced player 3 for the less<br>experienced.<br>The opening:<br>Because of the limitation on<br>placement, the opening might become very well versed <br>to<br>experienced players, so after a set number of moves, less<br>than five is probably <br>prefered. The two sides get<br>one chance in the game to switch<br>sides.<br><br>Commented<br>diagrams<br><br>8..........<br>7..........<br>6....M.....<br>5....OO....<br>4..M.XXM...<br>3..........<br>2....M.....<br>1..........<br> ABCDEFGHIJ<br><br>In this diagram X at E4 can<br>move to the places marked by M <br>but can't do so<br>even if it is its turn since no X is<br>currently<br>threatened.<br><br>8..........<br>7..PPPPPP..<br>6..PPPPPP..<br>5..PPOOPP..<br>4..PPXXPP..<br>3..PPPPPP..<br>2..PPPPPP..<br>1..........<br> ABCDEFGHIJ<br><br>Ps' in this diagram shows where<br>the next player can place his <br>piece given the<br>move so far.<br><br>All comments and questions<br>welcome!</div>
