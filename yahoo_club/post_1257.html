    <div>Thank you, gentlemen [Joao and Mark {T, I guess I have to add}], for<br>your answers. I understand the first two replies, anyhow, and now see<br>the/a difference between "mutators" and "rules", where I didn't<br>before. I'm hoping this is progress. [The computer-oriented 2nd post<br>of Joao's I let go by me; I've decided to be a dinosaur in the current<br>computer world, leaning on my son for what I need. For 10 years or so,<br>I was ahead of the curve - got my 1st computer in 1984; but now I've<br>given up re-re-re-learning everything every few years, and last week<br>bought my first computer with no floppy drive. Sigh. All those lovely<br>games I have, on floppies...]<br><br>Anyway, I did see Sagme's "diary", and left a comment there on this,<br>but it was apparently the wrong place. Following is the relevant<br>portion of my question on game/chess boards: "what I've been thinking<br>about, in terms of chess variants, is the effect of board geometry.<br>I've come to the tentative conclusion that at least some boards are<br>mutators, especially non-two-dimensional boards. Play chess on a 1-D,<br>3-D, 4-D... board, and you've substantially changed the game, without<br>necessarily changing any other rules." <br><br>Further thinking has convinced me 2D boards are just as much mutators;<br>put orthochess in the middle of a 10x10, and now the rooks can step<br>out 1 square to the side and zip along an edge to the opponent's back<br>row, where they're promptly taken by an unmoved knight; move the<br>knight and you lose the defense. A rook can drop back one to guard,<br>but then the opponent's rook can line up on the piece rank. This is<br>clearly a substantial change.<br><br>Does this concept of boards as mutators make sense? <br><br>Joe</div>
