    <div>From Gamut of Games:<br> "[...]And if he doesn't,<br>he is still assured a draw.<br> My answer to someone<br>who plays in this manner, is not to play with<br>him."<br><br>Indeed, I found that also to be a weak answer to a real<br>problem.<br>Another sentence that I don't agree from the Dover<br>edition (1992), <br>is when he says that 1982 marks the<br>end of a golden age of <br>serious games. It's true<br>that there is a flood of RPGs, Computer <br>Games, ...<br>but there are still many beautiful abstract games<br><br>being created.<br><br>Have said that, I do love Sackson<br>work, both his games and also his <br>almost<br>archeological work around old games, removing from oblivion<br><br>many otherwise doomed games. He has done a remarkable<br>work!<br><br>Of course, in the sense of just play for fun, two<br>people can <br>decide not to use the mirror strategy,<br>and still profit from <br>the game.<br><br>But the<br>fact is that the existence of the mirror strategy<br>creates<br>a big flaw. However, there is always ways to<br>prevent it, as Sackson<br>proposed. There are several<br>ways, ones more artificial then others,<br>Sackson's<br>2nd proposal seems a bit artificial.<br><br>Another<br>simple procedure is just to play those games on a odd<br>board,<br>say 7x7 or 9x9 for FOCUS. These boards have a Tengen<br>(center board)<br>that cannot be reflected, so the mirror<br>strategy is doomed to fail<br>sooner or later (like in Go,<br>as Greg pointed out).<br><br>Bests,<br><br>Joao<br>Pedro Neto</div>
