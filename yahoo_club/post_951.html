    <div>This is an invitation to participate in a survey for a PhD project <br>on the automatic design and evaluation of board games. The survey <br>simply involves downloading a game-playing program (450kb Windows <br>executable) then playing some games against the computer and <br>indicating which ones you prefer.<br><br>The survey will be run in a couple of weeks (details below). If you <br>are interested in participating, please reply to me at:<br>cameronb@...<br><br>Regards,<br>Cameron Browne<br><br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br><br>The Project<br>~~~~~~~~~~~<br>This PhD project investigates whether new abstract board games may <br>be generated by computer, and whether these new games may be <br>automatically measured for quality. New games are created by <br>evolving the rules of known games using genetic algorithm <br>techniques. Game quality is then estimated using a number of <br>statistical measurements during self-play. <br> <br>The aim of this survey is to determine which of these evolved games <br>human players deem to be the most successful, in order to determine <br>which statistical measurements are the best indicators of game <br>quality.<br> <br>The Survey<br>~~~~~~~~~~ <br>This survey takes the form of a single Windows executable "Ludi" <br>(approx 450kb) which is a generic game-playing program pre-loaded <br>with a database of evolved games. Your task is to play some of these <br>games against the computer opponent and indicate which you prefer.<br> <br>Each time you run Ludi, a pair of previously unseen games will be <br>randomly selected from the database. You will be shown the rules for <br>these two games and asked to do the following:<br>    1)  Play each of the two games (to completion) against <br>           the computer opponent. <br>    2)  Indicate which of the two games you prefer.<br>    3)  Submit your result for this pair.<br> <br>Pressing the "Submit" button will send an email containing your <br>result directly to me at cameronb@.... Ludi will try to <br>send the email via your mail program (if not running then Ludi will <br>try to launch it) so your mail program may notify you that third <br>party software is attempting to mail out. This is perfectly safe, <br>and I'm happy to provide the Ludi source code that does this upon <br>request. Results will remain confidential.<br> <br>It's expected that each game will take around 10-15 minutes to <br>evaluate. After comparing a pair of games, you may then load another <br>two randomly chosen games and repeat the process as often as you <br>like =96 the more results we get the better. We would greatly <br>appreciate all results being submitted within one week of receiving <br>the survey.<br> <br>Please note that Ludi is a generic game-player designed to play a <br>wide range of games at beginner level rather than any specific game <br>at expert level. It is expected that you will beat Ludi at most <br>games after a couple of attempts, but in doing so will get a feeling <br>for those games.<br> <br>Please also note that the evolved games will be of variable quality; <br>some will be bad and some will (hopefully) be good. Identifying bad <br>games is just as important as identifying good ones as we are <br>primarily interested in discovering those factors that indicate game <br>quality.<br> <br>Questions<br>~~~~~~~~~<br>Before downloading Ludi you will be asked a few questions, such as:<br>- Are you at least 18 years of age?<br>- How many years have you been playing board games?<br>- How often do you play board games?<br> <br>You will not have to answer any of these questions except for the <br>first one, which is required by QUT university policy for all <br>surveys undertaken under its name.</div>
