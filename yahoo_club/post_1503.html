    <div>Mark Steere Games - Summary of Recent Releases<br><br>1. Loophole 2D & 3D<br>2  Anchor 2D & 3D<br>3. Lariat 2D & 3D<br>4. Super Lariat (3D only.  A 2D version would be absurdly complicated.)<br>   <br>I'm still working on the Anchor 3D paper model as well as<br>re-engineering all of the other 3D models to make them sturdier.  I<br>should have all the cutouts and construction instructions completed in<br>the next couple of weeks.<br><br>All of the above games are win loss complementary (WLC), a term coined<br>by Bill Taylor. I.e., a filled board always produces exactly one<br>winner.  They're also equal goals games (or equivalent goals in the<br>case of Loophole).<br><br>For the last fifty years or so, all we had were Hex and Y - the super<br>simple connection games.  Enter Lariat.  And that's all there is. <br>Lariat was the last piece of a three piece puzzle.  Yes, there are<br>other WLC, equal goals games such as Eight-sided Hex, but none nearly<br>as simple as Hex, Y, and Lariat - the HYL triad.<br><br>Super Lariat is super exotic!  ***Super Lariat is the only closed<br>surface, WLC, equal goals game in existence*** (using only Go stones -<br>no plastic bridges or other gimmicks).  <br><br>With Atoll and Begird, I thought I had fully explored the<br>possibilities of Hex and Y generalization.  My reasoning at the time<br>was that neither the Hex nor Y principles can be adapted to a closed<br>surface, and therefore must be adapted to a surface with an edge.  I<br>stopped short of realizing that it should have been *at least one*<br>edge.  Behold Loophole and Anchor.<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
