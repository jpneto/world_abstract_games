    <div>Dear Miss V,<br>I am in a similar situation as<br>you. I live in a rural area of SE Oklahoma. You might<br>chech with your librarian. In small towns, they know<br>who likes to read what and can perhaps match you up<br>with others. If there is a nearby college, they<br>typically have game clubs - and might welcome an "outsider"<br>to participate. <br><br>Good luck!<br>Dick<br>Johnson<br>Clayton, OK</div>
