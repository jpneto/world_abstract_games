    <div>Hello to all -- The last bean dropped is also captured as in Kalah.  <br>Looks like I accidentally edited out that part of the rule when <br>describing Cross-Kalah (but it is coded that way). - Dan Troyka<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>> Hello,<br>> <br>> the Cross-Kalah help file says:<br>> <br>> "If the last bean is dropped in an empty friendly hole, any beans <br>in <br>> the opposing enemy hole are captured."<br>> <br>> Do you know if you also capture your own single bean which has <br>> effected the capture? I haven't bought the Zillions program, so I <br>> can't try the program.<br>> <br>> <br>> Please help,<br>> <br>> Ralf</div>
