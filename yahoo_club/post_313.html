    <div>> Dispatch isn't a new game, but a variant of Pentamino Go which was<br>> described by Wayne Schmittberger in his book "New Rules for Classic<br>> Games" (in: "Omino Go"). <br><br>The original idea was very different from any Go variant. <br>The problem is that its playability was not good, and while<br>changing the rules to improve the game, it turned out like<br>a kind of Omino Go (in fact, none of us thought about <br>its similarities with Omino Go until your post), but...<br><br>> Schmittberger's original game is more elegant, since it goes without<br>> artificial and unnecessary rules such as "dispatching" while they<br>> result in a game which is pretty much the same as Dispatch, except<br>> that it has more combinatorial variety.<br><br>...the dispatch restricts the placements of stones: your <br>next placement depends on where you drop your previous pieces, <br>and in this point it's very different from a typical <br>Go variant. You can secure a territory by preventing <br>the enemy to dispatch a platoon inside it, you don't <br>need two safe holes for that, like a true Go variant.<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
