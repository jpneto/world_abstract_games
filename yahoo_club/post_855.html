    <div>There are three problems an abstract game can have: draws, ties, and first<br>move advantage (by this I also mean to include second move advantage). Why<br>are these characteristics such a problem? The more expert players become,<br>the more prominent the flaws become. For example two expert Chess players<br>might have at least a 60 percent chance of having a draw, and in Checkers it<br>might be over 80 percent. To me draws are the bane of abstract games.<br>Picture yourself playing a friend and the game is taking twice the usual<br>amount of time. You realize it's a draw, but your opponent thinks he can win<br>with "just a little more time". In the end I have to concede it's just a<br>matter of opinion. Some Chess players pride themselves on being able to<br>force a draw. I pride myself on not releasing draw prone games. Of the three<br>afflictions, ties are probably the least offensive. But again, the more<br>expert players become, the more frequently ties will occur.<br><br><br><br>My first game, Quadrature, was infinite (subject to draw cycles).  My next<br>three games, Tanbo, Impasse, and Byte were finite and conclusive (no ties).<br>I did my best to make each of them highly resistant to first move advantage.<br>No game is perfect, but some are much more resistant to first move advantage<br>than others.  For example, Hex is finite and conclusive, but has a strong<br>first move advantage, even among beginners.  Someone invariably mentions the<br>"pie" or "swapping" rule.  This can be a useful rule for some games, but in<br>the case of Hex, merely converts first move advantage into second move<br>advantage.  In any case, the pie rule diminishes the elegance of set of<br>rules that would be simpler without it.<br><br><br><br>I've brought up this discussion before in other forums.  I usually challenge<br>the group to name games which are finite, conclusive, and resistant to first<br>move advantage.  The group response has become somewhat predictable. First<br>there are shouts of denial that my games stand out as being among the few to<br>have all three characteristics.  Eventually someone usually correctly names<br>Dots and Boxes, and incorrectly names Hex.  And then someone may angrily<br>demand to know, "Who cares anyway!?"  I do.  And I'm puzzled as to why other<br>game designers contemptuously reject these standards. If you're only<br>interested in creating flavor-of-the-month type games, then these standards<br>of quality probably don't matter.  But I think most of us would like our<br>games to be robust, and to stand up to years of increasingly expert<br>strategy.  What's the problem?<br><br><br><br>Mark Steere<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
