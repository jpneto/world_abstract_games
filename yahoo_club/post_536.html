    <div>Hello,<br><br>I'm searching more information on the stacking game "Tower of Power", <br>which was invented by Michael Baldwin. According to a Dutch book <br>author, it was described in the "Games and Puzzles Journal", probably <br>in 1985 or 1986. I don't have any issues of this magazine and was <br>unable to locate it in a library. You would make me very happy, if <br>you could help me. <br><br>I would like to know the title of the article, the author of the <br>article, the issue number and am interested in any information you <br>can possibly provide on this fantastic game.<br><br>Ralf</div>
