    <div>Hi Greg, <br><br>I always recommend using a much larger board than the space saving<br>size I use in the rule sheet.  This'll facilitate a richer game and<br>reduce the first move advantage.  I'd recommend whatever size gives<br>you about as many cells as you have in a Go board as the standard<br>size.  For a faster game I'd recommend 1/2 to 2/3 that number of cells.<br><br>I also recommend an even n so that there will be an even number of<br>cells, mostly for for aesthetic reasons.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Mark,<br>> <br>> The example in the rule sheet is for a game board where n=3D4.
