    <div>Almost forgot the last rule about forming 'houses'.<br><br>3. If the player forms a 'house', a triangle and square in the same <br>move, they may move a single friendly stone and two opposing stones. <br><br>In the extra movement of two opposing stones, it was also allowed to <br>either move two seperate stones or one stone two steps.  <br><br>And the extra movement of a friendly stone, it was allowed to move <br>the same one again as long as it did not return to its previous <br>position.  Such would violate the restriction against repetition of <br>position.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "interrupt27" <llsmith@e...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> I had to dig around in the top of my closet to locate this game.  <br>It <br>> was printed up to look like the album cover for an LP record.<br>> <br>> I remember playing lots of games with a few friends and we were not <br>> that very excited about it.  There seemed to be something missing.  <br>> The end-games just seemed to be inevitable.<br>> <br>> We tried a variant in which the following was allowed:<br>> <br>> 1. If the player was able to form a triangle, they had to option to <br>> move another stone of their own. Not an enemy stone.<br>> <br>> 2. If the player formed a square, they were able to move two enemy <br>> stones.<br>> <br>> And cascade of formations were allowed with rule 1.  So that if a <br>> player formed a triangle then moved a stone which formed another <br>> triangle then could move another stone.  This includes the <br>formation <br>> of a square resulting from such a move.  The only restriction being <br>> forbidding repetition of position.<br>> <br>> I know that this is only a slight modification to the original <br>first <br>> rule of triangle formation but it did liven the game up.  It also <br>> meant that forming squares became a little difficult if the <br>opponent <br>> was sharp.<br>></div>
