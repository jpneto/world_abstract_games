    <div>>>> here's the direct link<br>>>> [http://tinyurl.com/75q6m]<br><br>>> Could you play this physically<br>>> using the bits from Tile Chess?<br><br>> Tried to look for the rules of<br>> Tiles Chess, but couldn't find<br>> a proper version. The only one<br>> i could find had a pdf format<br>> that was turned sideways. If<br>> you know of any site with a<br>> proper link to the rules,<br>> could you post it here?<br><br>What I meant by my comment was, since the equipment<br>provided with Tile Chess is simply six complete Chess<br>sets, each printed on tiles of a different color, if<br>players didn't want to play your game sitting in front<br>of a computer, they could, instead, draw random pairs<br>of pieces from six differently colored Chess sets<br>(such as those from Tile Chess) and play your game on<br>a standard Chess board. Piece ownership could, as in<br>Shogi, be indicated by the tile orientation instead of<br>color.<br><br>So my comment had nothing to do with the rules to Tile<br>Chess, just that you could use the Tile Chess<br>equipment to play your game sans computer. I think<br>you'll find that many people prefer to play games with<br>physical pieces rather than on a computer. I know that<br>I do, because it hurts my eyes to stare at screens for<br>long periods of time.<br><br>Clark</div>
