    <div>To clarify my earlier point, I don't see computer solution spoiling the<br><br>game for human competitive play. In fact, it could even enhance human<br><br>play. It may lead to useful insights about the game, but those insights<br><br>are available to all human players. For instance, now that C4 is solved,<br><br>it may be easier to compile an opening book for the game, and if anything,<br><br>that would have the effect of increasing the sophistication of human game<br><br>play. I believe that's what is occurring now with Checkers.<br><br><br>=3D=3D> I agree.
