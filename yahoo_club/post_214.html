    <div>My comment to:<br><br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/halma.htm<br><br>>> GOAL - Wins the first player that moves at least one of his stones <br>>> to the enemy base, while that base is totally occupied.<br><br>This nonsense was first promoted by Wayne Schmittberger in his <br>book "New Rules for Classic Games" (which contains many more <br>mistakes).<br><br>Joao states correctly:<br><br>>> The goal is stated this way to prevent that players keep some of <br>>> their stones on their own base, to achieve trivial draws. However, <br>>> other trivial draws are still possible, check the second example. <br>>> In this case, a further fix to the goal must be added.<br><br>Ploog's proposal:<br><br>>> "A player wins if he cannot move any of his stones nearer to the <br>>> opposing corner and if all of his stones left his base."<br><br>While Ploog's proposal appears to be promising, I would like to <br>describe another solution to the problem which is known in Germany <br>for at least half a century:<br><br>"If one player has left his base, the other player must also leave <br>his base (or move towards the exit of his base). Other moves are not <br>permitted."<br><br>The beauty of this solution is that the original winning condition of <br>Halma remains unchanged.<br><br>Another statement by Joao:<br><br>>> Another well known variant, played on a star-shaped board, is <br>>> Chinese Checkers (btw, the game is not Chinese - it's German - and <br>>> it's not even a variant of Checkers :-)<br><br>It's German? I recently found in a German gamebook that Chinese <br>Checkers / Sternhalma was first popular in Sweden. So the game might <br>well be Swedish.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
