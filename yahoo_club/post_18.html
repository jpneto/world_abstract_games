    <div>Hi!<br><br>>What about symmetry with respect<br>to each player's options? <br><br>I believe that is<br>a good feature, that give a sense of fairness to<br>both players. <br><br>>The reason such symmetry is<br>common in games, is probably because <br>>it<br>minimizes the advantage of moving first or second; without<br><br>>symmetry of movement choice, one player is likely to have<br>an <br>>advantage.<br><br>The other side (like<br>Fox and Geese) is also very interesting, <br>but a<br>LOT more harder to create a balanced game. If you<br>don't <br>have much time and resources to play test<br>extensively, you <br>should focus on symmetric armies! I think<br>this is one of the main<br>reasons for their<br>success.<br><br>To balanced the 1st move advantage, there are some<br>conceptual tools:<br><br>* odd-move equalization (like Renju<br>or Gonnect)<br>* multiple moves equalization, like<br>Marsellais Chess's 1-2-2-2-... <br> moves per turn, or<br>Progressive Chess's 1-2-3-4-5-...<br><br>>Another issue is<br>interaction. A good game should encourage interaction<br><br>>between players. In some games I have thought of, it<br>turns out a player <br>>can do quite well by<br>completely ignoring his opponent. <br><br>I agree, but<br>that's a feature (at some extent) of Go's Fuseki.<br>Anyway,<br>offensive should always be the best defense on a good<br>abstract game.<br>But on the other side, a player should<br>have defensive mechanics to<br>support weak attacks,<br>otherwise, each player's army structure is not<br>so<br>important, which may be a bad thing.<br><br>>Another<br>issue is clarity of goal. [...] the "location" of your<br>goal <br>>should always be clear. <br><br>I also<br>agree on that. But, once more, the winning goal of Go<br>is somewhat<br>fuzzy, achieve more territory, which<br>can be sometimes very hard to tell<br>how things are<br>going.<br><br>>Another issue: "property rights". I very much prefer<br>games in which <br>>I own my pieces. So I prefer<br>games like chess and Hex over games <br>>like Nim<br>and Dots-&-Boxes. <br><br>And, if you are not in a<br>commercial mood, a new game should try to reuse<br>pieces<br>already owned by typical players (like go, chess and<br>draught pieces)<br><br>>That is all I can think of at<br>the moment. This is a nice games club, but there just<br>>aren't that many people with this interest. Oh well.<br><br><br>I also agree, but at least it exists and messages<br>don't get deleted :) <br>As the maintainer, I should<br>take more time to take care of it. I will<br>try.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
