    <div>Before getting to my point a definition<br>first:<br><br>Capture Sequence: A series of consecutive turns in which<br>each turn includes a capture.<br><br>I have thought<br>more on this topic and think I have a way to eliminate<br>any possibility of a draw through infinite capture<br>sequences by stipulating the following:<br><br>Anbody who<br>repeats a turn in a capture sequence must announce the<br>repetition after the turn. After which the opponent cannot<br>respond the same way as was done before to any of the<br>previous incarnation of this turn in this capture<br>sequence. So within a capture sequence, the responses to<br>every repetition of a turn must be different.<br><br><br>So the full rule on irreversible gain would include<br>the above rule and the one below:<br><br>The person<br>who makes the last capture in the capture sequence<br>get one stone toward the fullfillment of their<br>contracts.</div>
