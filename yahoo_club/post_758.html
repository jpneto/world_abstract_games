    <div>http://wcbo.iepe.net/<br>http://wcbo.iepe.net/<br>http://wcbo.iepe.net/<br><br>Chessboxing<br><br>The basic idea in chessboxing is to combine the no.1 thinking sport<br>and the no.1 fighting sport into a hybrid that demands the most of <br>its<br>competitors ? both mentally and physically.<br><br>In a chessboxing fight two opponents play alternating rounds of chess<br>and boxing. The contest starts with a round of chess, followed by a<br>boxing round, followed by another round of chess and so on. In every<br>round of chess the FIDE rules for a =B4Blitz game=B4 apply, in every<br>boxing round the AIBA rules apply with the following extensions and<br>modifications:<br><br>In a contest there shall be 11 rounds, 6 rounds of chess, 5 rounds of<br>boxing. A round of chess takes 4 minutes. Each competitor has 12<br>minutes on the chess timer. As soon as the time runs out the game is<br>over. A round of boxing takes 2 minutes. Between rounds there is a 1<br>minute pause, during which competitors change their gear.<br><br>The contest is decided by: checkmate (chess round), exceeding the <br>time<br>limit (chess round), retirement of an opponent (chess or boxing<br>round), KO (boxing round), or referee decision (boxing round). If the<br>chess game ends in a stalement, the opponent with the higher score in<br>boxing wins. If there is an equal score, the opponent with the black<br>pieces wins.<br><br>http/www.chessearth.blogspot.com<br><br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/rythmomachy/<br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/rythmomachy/</div>
