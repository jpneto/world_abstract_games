    <div>You can find information on Near vs Normal Chess here:<br>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/35799<br><br>Near Chess was discovered in an attempt to adapt Christian Freeling's<br>Grand Chess to an 8x8 board.  This produced a formation where both<br>sets of pieces shift up one row.  This was streamlined even more by<br>dropping castling, how pawn promotion works and having king captured<br>instead of checkmate.  Near Chess is positioned as a chess variant<br>friendly for those who don't normally play chess.<br><br>Anyhow, out of development of Near Chess came the question about how<br>pieces following Near Chess rules would do against those following<br>normal chess rules.  To answer this question,  Near vs Normal Chess<br>was created to pit pieces following Near Chess rules against those<br>following normal chess rules. Initially I thought the Near Chess side<br>would have no chance.  However, it ended up initially being closer<br>than I expected, running it on the computer and personally playing it<br>against human opponents.<br><br>After running the game a bunch of times over Zillions, I would likely<br>give a slight edge to the Normal side, but I am not sure. I would like<br>people here to perhaps speculate on which side has an advantage. Let's<br>say we follow all of normal chess rules, except the Near side changes<br>things this way:<br>1. Near moves its pieces up one row.<br>2. Near doesn't castle.<br>3. Near can En Passant Normal's pawns, but due to the limited movement<br>of Near's Pawns can't be En Passanted.<br><br>Game is won on checkmate, and like in normal chess, you can have more<br>pieces than usual counter mix. So, the question is, which side has an<br>advantage in your assessment?<br><br>Near's advatages are:<br>1. Its pawns can be defended easier early, and aren't subject to en<br>passant. In Near vs Normal, en passant is treated as a weakness with<br>Normal chess pawns, not as a move that normal chess pawns do<br>distinctly. The pressure Near's pawns put on the center also restricts<br>how Normal would develop its pieces.<br>2. It can't be subject to a back rank mate or fool's mate.<br>3. Its pawns all start one row closer, meaning more pressure across<br>the entire board on the center.<br>4. Its rooks can get mobilized earlier.<br>5. Its Knight, Bishop and Queen can mobilize behind its and protect<br>themselves. Normal must bring its pieces out in front of its pawns<br>normally to mobilize them.<br><br>Near's disadvantages:<br>1. No castling. King stays in middle of the board.<br>2. Near's non-pawn pieces are a bit limited in how they mobilize. If<br>you bring a knight out, for example, Normal can manage to push a pawn<br>2 spaces, threatening to capture the Knight.<br><br><br>So, I will ask, which side do you believe has an advantage? My take is<br>the sides are likely close enough to be able to have skill offset any<br>advantage, but Normal probably has a slight edge.  However, this<br>represents play in Zillions mostly, so it is only one computer AI.<br><br>I ask this question, because if the sides are close enough, then Near<br>vs Normal could be a variant people could play normally to mix things<br>up, as a side game.  If one side clearly has an edge over the other,<br>then the stronger player could take the weaker side.  Of course, there<br>is white vs black, and perhaps that would also impact things in that<br>maybe White Normal vs Black Near is an advantage for Near, while White<br>Near vs Black Normal is an advantage for Normal.  I don't know, which<br>is why I ask here.<br><br>I guess also it would answer the question of whether or not castling<br>plus intial pawn double move is stronger than all pieces shifted up<br>one, and an empty back rank, without castling.  <br><br>Comments are welcomed here.  I am curious to see what people might<br>have as thoughts regarding this.<br><br>- Rich</div>
