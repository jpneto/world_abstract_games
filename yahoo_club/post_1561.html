    <div>Definitely.  A larger board provides richer gameplay and a smaller board provides a faster game as rules of thumb.  I think that would hold even with this zugswang issue.  But I'd make a 420/X board a row smaller than I'd make a Hex board just because 420/X is more complicated, in a sense. <br><br>Now I get to thinking about it though, you've got three players adding stones and they're going to need more room to spread their wings.  In the end it's fairly arbitrary.  I could never recommend a tiny board like the ones in the diagrams, but I leave that decision up to the programmers.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "ddyer0" <ddyer-yahoogroups1@...> wrote:<br>><br>> <br>> I've been thinking more about this game, including the zero seeking<br>> player's problem with zugswang on the last move.
