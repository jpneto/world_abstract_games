    <div>This discussion has got me thinking of potential scoring methods.<br><br>What if the players, recieved a set point value for winning each game <br>but the recieve point values for each of their pieces captured.<br><br>The winning value could be about half the total value of the player's <br>pieces, thus forcing each player to sacrifice a fair number of men in <br>order to achieve a final winning score in the tournament.<br><br>There would also reach a point in the game where a losing player <br>would be better off if the winner continue to take pieces.</div>
