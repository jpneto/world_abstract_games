    <div>Joao Neto: I asked for guesses as to how to<br>improve Othello. You were really close to my idea when<br>you guessed "May drop opponent pieces". Also, I<br>followed your suggestion and entered my "Sacrifice<br>Reversi" into the 8x8 abstract games<br>competition.<br><br>8x8 Reversi (also known as Othello) is boring. The<br>algorithm for optimal play is fairly simple, and most<br>people figure it out after playing only a few games.<br>After that it isn't much fun to play any more. Getting<br>a computer to play perfectly is pretty simple, and<br>has been done by many a first-year computer<br>programmer.<br><br>I have invented a simple, intuitive rule change<br>which breathes new life into the entire Reversi game<br>family. Plus, it makes better use of the two-sided<br>Reversi pieces than Reversi does<br>itself!<br><br>"Sacrifice Reversi" uses the standard Reversi board, pieces,<br>and rules, plus a "sacrifice" rule: Instead of making<br>a regular Reversi move, you can choose to flip one<br>of your own pieces (i.e., one already on the board)<br>to your opponent's color. Your opponent cannot flip<br>the same piece back on the very next turn, but they<br>can flip it back anytime later in the game. (Your<br>opponent can make a regular Reversi move, or flip a<br>different piece from their color to your color. Then it's<br>your turn again.)<br><br>This dramatically changes the<br>play of the game! By sacrificing a piece to your<br>opponent, you can make it more difficult for them to get<br>pieces on the most valuable squares of the board. This<br>also increases the number of choices for each move; in<br>ordinary Reversi there are only a few legal moves to<br>consider on each turn. Note that the total number of<br>pieces on the board either stays the same or increases<br>with each move. The game is over when the board is<br>full or when both players pass. The winner is then<br>determined by counting pieces as in standard<br>Reversi.<br><br>Variants: <br><br>If desired, players may agree to an<br>"n-time repetition is a draw" rule, whereby if the same<br>board position occurs more than "n" times with the same<br>player to move, the game is a draw. Players should<br>select some reasonably small value for n, such as 3 or<br>5.<br><br>In standard Reversi, a player may pass only when<br>they have no legal play. In "Sacrifice Reversi", when<br>a player has no regular Reversi move, they will<br>usually have a piece they can sacrifice by flipping it<br>over. Players can agree on any "pass" rule they want.<br>Possiblities include: <br><br> 1: "If you have any legal<br>regular or sacrifice moves, you must make one of them or<br>resign."<br> 2: "If you have no regular move, you may choose<br>to sacrifice a piece, or choose to pass."<br> 3:<br>"You may choose to move or pass anytime it is your<br>turn."<br><br>Most of the variants which have been invented for<br>Reversi can be turned into "sacrifice" variants using the<br>above "sacrifice" rule. This includes variants which<br>change the board size or shape, the starting<br>configuration, the rule(s) for when pieces get flipped, where<br>pieces can be played, and so on. <br><br>With suitable<br>pieces (or in a computer implementation) you can have<br>more than two players, or even neutral pieces. When<br><br>sacrificing a piece, the moving player can choose to change<br>one of his own pieces to any of the other<br>colors.<br><br>Enjoy the game, and feel free to write me if you have<br>any questions. I'm working on a Zillions of Games<br>implementation; Send me an email if you want a copy of the *.zrf<br>file when I finish it. <br><br>-- <br>regards, Patrick<br>Duff <pduff@...></div>
