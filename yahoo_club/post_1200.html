    <div>I received this from Joe Joyce from the Chess variants website<br>regarding this:<br>Well, there's a website that will give you random positions here:<br>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/fischerandom<br>But if you want to do it manually, there are controversies. Following <br>are 2 URLs, one for FRC, and one for the FRC comments:<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/fischer.html<br>http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?itemid=3DFischerRandomChe<br><br>To do a free manual setup, you can let one player place the 1st B, the <br>other the 2nd B on a different color square, first place 1 R, 2nd the <br>other R, 1st the K, 2nd the Q, and the 2 Ns are forced. This is just my <br>own sense of what would work more or less okay from reading about it. <br>I'm no expert, I'm 2-1 in FRC, with computer-generated positions, so <br>that's no experience. This would not give you an even chance for all<br>960  positions, I "strongly suspect", because there's psychology in<br>the placement of the pieces when allowing the players to choose the <br>positions of the pieces.<br><br>Joe</div>
