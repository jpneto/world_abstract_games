    <div>> The book does in fact Dvonn.<br><br>Dvonn is mentioned, in fact (but not given in your "List of Games").<br><br>Let me compare it to Gonnect which you've included as a connection <br>game. <br><br>Dvonn is often won by an experienced player who plays against a <br>beginner by cutting off his opponent's stones, so "connection" can be <br>a dominating / decisive theme in Dvonn. Limiting or killing your <br>opponent's pieces becomes the goal only when Dvonn is played by <br>advanced players (and even they would rather say, that Dvonn is about <br>mobility).<br><br>Gonnect is a connection game in the "race stage" (hot), and a <br>territorial game in the "territory-filling stage" (cold). Experienced <br>players should usually survive the hot stage, so that Gonnect mutates <br>to a territorial game, IF played by two advanced players, but could <br>often remain a connection game, IF at least one player is a beginner.<br><br>Whether a game belongs to a certain class or not might in some games <br>also depend on the strength of those playing it.<br><br>Ralf</div>
