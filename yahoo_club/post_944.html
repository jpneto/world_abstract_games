    <div>I guess it would be a draw if both players *perceived* their cyclical moves<br>to be optimal.  That is, neither would be willing to break the cycle.  I<br>should just buy the game and test it out.  I emailed the company that<br>manufactures it but they didn't respond.<br><br>On 3/13/06, Doug Orleans <dougorleans@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Mark Steere writes:<br>> > Does anyone know if draws can occur in Pylos?
