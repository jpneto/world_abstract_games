    <div>While Gobblet may be a draw with perfect play, I don't think the <br>reason given is sufficiently convincing.  You must have at least <br>four pieces on the board to win.  If a larger gobblet "captures" a <br>smaller goblett, but moves away, the smaller goblett is exposed <br>again.  This can serve to "pin" your opponent's large gobletts and <br>deprive him of moves.  If one player just tries to move his large <br>gobblets around the board, and the other player keeps placing <br>smaller goblets, eventually there will be a threat that can't be <br>convered.<br>Can you provide an example of a game where one player with just the <br>three large goblets (plus the threat of placing a fourth) draws <br>against a more typical style of play?  It need not be perfect, just <br>an example of an ordinary game, so we can see how it might be done.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "truthforum2001" <br><Peace_Panther@h...> wrote:<br>> Gobblet is a draw in perfect play.
