    <div>I actually think Othello is pretty strong in both Depth and Clarity,<br>considering the small/simple field of play etc.  Of course, in order to<br>attain clarity one has to understand the basic strategy of maximizing <br>mobility and the tactics of edge-and-corners play.  To a novice who<br>only counts material, the game would be pretty chaotic and opaque.<br><br>Unfortunately, due to both the small board size and the clarity of the <br>game, computers have been unbeatable since early on.  To increase<br>depth, perhaps we should consider a larger board with multiple initial<br>islands, say 13x13 with four islands or 19x19 with nine.
