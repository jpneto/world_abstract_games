    <div>I think that that question of irreversible gain<br>gets too complicated.<br>I don't know if it's possible<br>to create a cyclic capturing sequence<br>that would<br>led to draw (a sort of perpetual check in FIDE<br>Chess),<br>but a super KO rule would solve it?<br><br>Perhaps<br>you should include that only if a player is able at<br>the <br>end of the turn, to fulfill his contract,<br>while the opponent is<br>not, then and only then he<br>wins (as in Epaminondas), if both<br>players achieve<br>the contract, then:<br><br>* draw the game, OR<br>*<br>each contract increases by one<br><br>Anyway, perhaps<br>the new proposal to balance the capturing edge<br>will<br>also be good on this subject ("the capturing stone is<br>also removed",<br>and so the number of stones is<br>always balanced)<br><br>Joao</div>
