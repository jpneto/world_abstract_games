It was really<br>too much<br>different from Go. You could hardly capture any chain<br>-<br>not to mention isolated stones - because your<br>opponent would<br>increase some end of it before getting<br>captured. You would then<br>need more moves than her to<br>threaten the chain again. I'm afraid<br>the game would<br>turn into an algebra of unlimited increases.<br>Maybe<br>territories would only exist through some mathematical<br>analysis.<br>This all reminds me too much of financial<br>theories.<br><br>We could allow increases but forbid any fraction<br>bigger than 1. I<br>don't like it because fractions<br>would still only exist through<br>their potentiality to<br>become whole. It keeps an aftertaste of the<br>previous<br>problem. Instead of that I would like fractions<br>to<br>behave much like whole stones at their level and to be<br>more<br>fragile than whole stones.<br><br>> Only by trying and<br>playing, we can reach better conclusions<br><br>I<br>collected feelings from similar experiences, but you are<br>right,<br>I cannot swear they are entirely accurate in the<br>current<br>situation.<br><br>> That should be a must. "Weaker frontiers, but<br>still valid territory!"<br>> I think you should base<br>the game on this principle. Valid territory<br>><br>when counting, but weak frontiers open to attack until<br>the game ends.<br><br>Nicely put. One subtlety<br>however, to keep the rules as much<br>consistent and<br>orthogonal as possible: A territory's value would<br>be the<br>maximum amount of stones and parts of stones in it<br>you<br>could capture from your opponent. Example, the<br>following left<br>upper corner is worth 3 points and a<br>half.<br><br>__ __ oo __ __<br>__ __ o_ __ __<br>oo oo __ __<br>__<br>__ __ __ __ __<br><br>Here is again the capture<br>rule, in a recursive nutshell:<br><br>A stone or a<br>fraction of stone is *living* if and only if it<br>is<br>adjacent to an empty spot or to a smaller opposite<br>fraction or to<br>a living friendly fraction.<br><br>><br>...
