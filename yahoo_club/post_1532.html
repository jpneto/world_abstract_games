    <div>Tyr grew from my dissatisfaction with Hasami-Shogi.  The "5 in-a-row" version tends to be too short.  And the "War" version tends to be too long.  So I sat down and tried to see if I could come up with some tweaks to the game that would allow for a more happy medium.  <br><br>The biggest problem with the "5 in-a-row" version is that it is much too easy for a player to build a line on their side of the board.  I moved up two rows the area where a line of 5 would count.  This would force the player to build a line within the five rows on their opponents side of the board.  It made the game a little bit more challenging, but I still was not satisfied.<br><br>I then turned to the "War" version.  I knew I could make the game more dynamic if I gave a few pieces the power to move and capture diagonally.  In exchange these new "royal" pieces would allow for a secondary objective.  The player could win either by eliminating most of a large number of plain pieces or by eliminating all of a small number of special pieces.  This did improve gameplay, but again I wasn't satisfied.<br><br>I was running into the same issues with this new version as I was with the classic version.  Most games of elimination, such as Chess or Checkers, only require two pieces to complete a capture - the attacking piece and the captured piece.  However, Hasami-Shogi is a game of coordiantion, so three pieces are required for a capture.  By mid-game most of the pieces have become spread all over the board.  So to arrange three pieces together to make a capture becomes a long and tedious process.  I needed a reason to give the players to risk bunching up their pieces, thus making captures easier.<br><br>That's when I decided to combine my modified "5 in-a-row" version with my new "War" variant.  I think this makes for a richer game while still retaining the essence of the classic.<br><br>The rules for Tyr can be found here:<br><br>http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/82354?do=3Dshow;id=3D1701</div>
