    <div>> time when they were born.  In regard to Bombardment, which was<br>> released just a week or two before the Iraque war, the board design<br>> and the pieces obviously mirror the public discussion going on <br>about<br>> Iraqui weapons of mass destructions and illegal missles. <br>> <br>> Actually Bombardment is a good playable game, although the "theme" <br>is,<br>> in my opinion, a little bit tasteless.<br>> <br>> <br><br>Don't you think Bombardment is better described as a classic war <br>game in which nuclear powers face off with ICBMs over an ocean, the <br>sort of thing the Rand Corporation might have put out as an <br>application of game theory?  To the extent it models the invasion of <br>Iraq, it models numerous other conflicts equally well.  If you want <br>to see a game invoking imagery of the "war on terror", try Luiz <br>Carlos Campos' Unconventional Warfare Chess, which I implemented for <br>the Chess Variant Pages' 84-square contest.  It explicitly uses <br>chemical and biological weapons, tactical nuclear weapons, special <br>forces, etc.  It's even more tasteless than Bombardment, and almost <br>as tasteless as chess. <br><br>> <br>> It might be true for some games that colors do not have much <br>meaning,<br>> but I doubt that it was just a conincidence in Bombardment. <br>> 90% of games still use white and black pieces which originally<br>> symbolized either good and evil (in western games of enemy<br>> extermination) or the Yin & Yang principle (in eastern games of<br>> territorial coexistance).<br>> <br><br>I use blue and red all the time because they contrast well against a <br>light background.  (This is partly a graphical representation issue <br>for computer games).  Only in one game did I ascribe nationality to <br>the colors, and in that case it was English (Red) and French (Blue).<br><br>> <br>> My dear Dan, Iraque fired several missles at Kuwait during the<br>> invasion. Sadly, this is a fact, not propaganda. And they even had<br>> missles with a longer range than permitted. <br><br><br>I had in mind ICBM's, which Iraq would have to have to fit <br>the "shoreline to shoreline" theme of the game.  <br><br>> <br>> Paul Yearout wrote:<br>> <br>> "We had a tournament. The opening is too long and too <br>inconsequential.<br>> There are many sequences of moves any of which could produce the <br>same<br>> configuration prior to actual contact with oppsing forces. I found<br>> that a little dull. (...)"<br>> <br>> AG, Issue 9, Spring 2002, page 2.<br>> <br>> <br><br>Yearout didn't address the board size issue.  I wrote a response to <br>his letter but never sent it, because I wasn't sure of myself.  My <br>opinion, ultimately, is that openings matter but that they are not <br>as interesting as I would like them to be.  7x7 promises quicker <br>engagement and the presence of a unique middle row counteracts the <br>tendency to hang back on one's side of the board, and allows more <br>potent threats.  Or so I hope.  I haven't played on that size enough <br>to be confident in my assessment.<br><br><br>> <br>> Alta is a fascinating game and should be played tournamentwise. In <br>my<br>> opinion, it's one of the best connection games. Why not find a<br>> publisher? If you have nice looking pieces and a quality board, the<br>> game becomes an aesthetic pleasure too. I usually play it, I <br>think, on<br>> 85 squares. <br>> <br><br>I hope to re-release it on 85 squares.  The game is derived from <br>Gale/Bridg-it which I find fascinating to behold, although <br>unfortunately it was solved.  I've never tried to publish anything <br>commercially out of concern that the limited market and long odds of <br>success don't justify the effort.</div>
