    <div>><br>> discussion of wei-ch'i and Maoist guerillas<br>><br><br>My comments were directed at the claim that Bombardment models the <br>U.S. invasion of Iraq.  Your evidence was that blue missiles "could" <br>be considered American and red missiles "could" be considered as <br>representing Iraq, Iran, or North Korea.  You then tied this <br>interpretation of the game to a version of Morris released in Nazi <br>Germany featuring a swastika.  This is quite a stretch and I think <br>unfair to the game designer.  "Blue" is not a uniquely American <br>color and "red" is not unique to the countries you cite. Both colors <br>are commonly used in boardgames without any intention of designating <br>a particular country.  None of the so-called "axis of evil" <br>countries have missiles that could reach the U.S. (okay, nobody <br>knows for sure about NK), and at any rate none were fired by Iraq <br>during the invasion.  The analogy simply doesn't work, which is why <br>I assume you failed to mention it in your response. <br><br>> <br>> Dan, you have invented some good games (Alta, Breakthrough and <br>Sabin Rains), <br>> but why did you enlarge Breakthrough from 7x7 (as first published <br>in <br>> Zillions) to 8x8? Just to participate in the contest of AG <br>magazine? True <br>> you have won the contest, but many readers then complained about <br>your game <br>> in letters to the editor published in the next issue of AG because <br>the game <br>> turned out to be rather lengthy. The larger board does not add <br>much depth to <br>> the game, but makes the opening quite boring. In my opinon, it's a <br>childish <br>> behaviour to worsen a good game for participating in a contest! <br>Before you <br>> did that, Breakthrough was just perfect! My suggestion: enlarge <br>your Alta <br>> board a little bit, but go back to your former board size in <br>Breakthrough.<br>> <br>><br><br>Anybody who had concerns about the issue of the change in board size <br>was free to ask me. Only one person did, long after the competition. <br>Breakthrough originally began as a modification of Chris Huntoon's <br>Fairy Tale Draughts (9x9), which I thought might be improved by <br>eliminating lateral movement. I switched to an 8x8 board and then <br>decided to eliminate every rule I could, with the aim of making a <br>move-based game with as simple a rule set as possible. I then <br>released the game as 5x5 through 7x7 because, at the time, I liked <br>smaller, quicker games. I re-released the game with an 8x8 board <br>variant when I submitted it to the tournament. At the time I felt <br>that 8x8 had more depth.  I am now coming around -- admittedly <br>slowly -- to your opinion but I have trouble finding human opponents <br>on 7x7.  Apparently some people have a generic preference for 8x8 <br>which stems from the standard chess/checkers board.<br><br>I don't find the board size history particularly relevant to the <br>issue of game play. The criticism of 8x8 seems to be that openings <br>are inconsequential because they lead to a narrow set of mid-game <br>positions. I don't find this to be true but apparently I'm in a <br>minority. To the extent people don't like openings simply because <br>they take too long to get to the capturing phase (10 to 20 rounds), <br>I share this opinion in part (and hence my leaning to 7x7) but the <br>criticism applies to many games.<br><br>I've neglected Alta and need to go back and try it on a larger board <br>as you suggest.</div>
