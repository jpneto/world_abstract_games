    <div>Hi all, Shinermons.<br><br>Just wanted to say hello. I found this site whist taking a break <br>from writing up my new game. I wonder....hold on there a sec...<br><br>Yep, there you go, an abridge synopsis.<br><br>Any chineese speakers out there?<br><br>Yang-Te; The Tai Chi Game=99 <br><br>=A9 Colin Leamon 21/09/07. Shinermons Games.<br><br>For two players, Yin & Yang/ Black & White, with sixty pieces each <br>(called????) the object of the game is to occupy/ win/ hold the most <br>cells in a majority of the four boards. Taking turns, with Black <br>going first, a players go is to lay one of his pieces on a board, if <br>he is able, per go. If, after The Set Up, that player makes <br>a `Harmony' in a cell he lays one of his pieces in that cell of that <br>board. <br>=95	The moment a player runs out of pieces (even though pieces <br>maybe returned to him at the end of his go, or after his opponents <br>go) he must `knock-knock' on the table; his opponent must then take <br>one more go, if he is able to & the game is then over. The boards <br>are then scored separately & then, if you wish, the number of board <br>won & the scores are totalled to give a `Match Score'.<br>=95	Players can lay anywhere (see `Removals') & do not have to <br>make Harmonys with their lays; just as long as the Points/ Meridian <br>balance is kept throughout.<br>=95	Players can only "Pass" if they can not lay. If they can lay <br>they must lay.<br><br>The game board itself is made up of Seasons & `Winds'. Each board is <br>made up of a grid of cells. The cells themselves are made up <br>of `Points', `Meridians', & a `Virtue'.<br><br>The very middle of the board is called `The Tai Chi'</div>
