    <div>Here is another thing you don't do:<br> gloat about someone else's being kicked off a list for doing things you<br>do yourself.<br> brag about how good you are in your own games! I don't see you playing<br>many games that you didn't design yourself.<br> "establish your intellectual superiority with bluster, belligerence,"<br>yes, a perfect description of yourself.<br>Why don't you just shut up and play the games. Which is what I'll do now<br>(until the next time you provoke me into wasting my time against my<br>better judgment).<br><br><br>On Tue, 31 Oct 2006, Mark Steere wrote:<br><br>> Here's what you don't do:  You don't show up at Super Duper Games,<br>> declare all of the games there to be "boring," and then try to<br>> establish your intellectual superiority with bluster, belligerence,<br>> and hysterical temper tantrums.
