    <div>There is a new game out there, Arimaa.<br>Anybody heard of it? The authors are a computer<br>scientist and his very young son, they made<br>a simple and funny game from a Chess set, I<br>love it. It's going to be tough to make a<br>computer opponent. There may be as many as<br>10 000 valid moves, although the game looks<br>easier than Go to humans. It's not the main<br>interest of this game, but they challenge<br>the world with a prize for an A.I. better<br>than humans before the next 20 years. I'll<br>try! Anyway, the game is rich and balanced<br>and yield some surprises :-)<br><br>http://arimaa.com<br><br>Cheers<br>Claude</div>
