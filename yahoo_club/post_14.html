    <div>Here is what I like about Scalus. The idea of<br>changing the size of a rectangle of stones is very<br>original. Also, it seems like a "natural" concept. That is,<br>it seems like a sensible basis for a game. I have<br>not tried the game yet.<br>Questions to ask: is there<br>a symmetry strategy? Can one player simply copy his<br>opponent's moves?<br>(I would think not, because you have<br>captures in the game. But something to think<br>about.)<br>Can the game repeat? In which case you might consider<br>something like the "Super Ko" rule, as in the classic game<br>of Go.<br>Finally, Scalus shares some<br>characteristics with another game called "Guess", or "GoChess".<br>Read about this interesting game<br>at<br><a href=http://www.dfki.de/~endres/games/gochess/index-eng.html target=new>http://www.dfki.de/~endres/games/gochess/index-eng.html</a><br>or<br><a href=http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/archim/eureka/gess/ target=new>http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/archim/eureka/gess/</a><br><br>Good luck with Scalus !</div>
