Alf is a favorite TV show alien<br>from the past who liked to eat cats.  Please don't degenerate the<br>memory of Alf, by calling Ralf that.  Well, unless you happen to know<br>that he actually does eat cats, then you may be on to something :-P<br> <br>* The rest of Ralf deleted for others to read in the other post *<br><br>I am not going to speculate on what 20 different possible definitions<br>of simultaneous turns is :-P</div>
