String Go seems like a fun idea to play around with.<br>> ><br>> > Steve<br>> ><br>><br>><br>> I did not re-interate the standard rules of Go but they would be in<br>> effect.  The ko rule, passing, etc. would apply to the game.  You<br>> would not be allowed to "suicide" a stone and the "right of way" rule<br>> would apply.  The ko condition does not appear to be that common in<br>> this particular game.<br>><br>> The primary win condition appears to be a "motivator".  The size of<br>> the playing field is what greatly effects it.  The size which I've<br>> recommended does appear to limit this possibility, so players might<br>> feel free to experiment with larger areas.  But too large and the<br>> game just becomes a race to fill the area.<br>><br>> I've found that the use of a simple measuring device comes in handy.<br>> I made one from a kitchen matchstick, whittling it to the length of a<br>> one and one-half stone.  Also, the "looks-like-a-duck" rule was<br>> applied.  If the placed stone looks adjacent, it is adjacent.<br>><br>> The necessity of placing stones either adjacent or at a distance of<br>> one and one-half stone was to create the needed conditions for<br>> strategic play.  It is a fairly simple rule to follow and leaves<br>> little room for arguments during the game.  One of the opening<br>> tactics is limiting your opponent's non-adjacent placements.  The<br>> initial seeding of the playing field is an interesting area for<br>> strategy.  It also makes it tough to create those initial strings.<br>><br>> It is necessary to sacrifice a few stones in order to bring your<br>> stones within proximity.  This is done with the three-stone ring<br>> formation, the threat and capture thereof.  You can place a stone<br>> adjacent an opponent so that its capture will bring the opponent<br>> stone near another of your stones or adjacent to one of its own.<br>> When you are able to bring two stones near enough to join, you will<br>> create you first string.<br>><br>> The opportunity for capturing a string is difficult to achieve.  Most<br>> often you will attempt to limit the size of your opponent's<br>> formations.  By looping your string back in on itself, so that there<br>> is no room for opposing placement at one of its ends, this string<br>> is "safe" and you can use it as a threat.  In fact, it can travel<br>> across the field, gobbling up any opposing loners.<br>><br>> Blocking a string is another tactic.  You definitely don't want to<br>> allow an opponent to freely form any string across the field.  You<br>> can use one of your strings to cut off the path of an opposing<br>> string.  This blocking string might be a "safe" one or not.  The<br>> player who has several small strings can beat the player with one big<br>> string.  You definitely don't want to find yourself with only one<br>> blocked string and no "seeds" on the field.<br>><br>> I can't see the necessity of "splitting" any string.  Either by the<br>> player, or the opponent.  Once a string is formed, it lives or dies<br>> as a string.  This is the foundation of the game.<br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>> --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>------<br>> Yahoo! Groups Links<br>><br>>   a..
