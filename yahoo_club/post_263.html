    <div>> .......<br>> .......<br>> .xxoo..<br>> xooxo..<br>> xossxo.<br>> <br>> The two points marked "s" are shared territory.<br><br>This position isn't possible in actual play (I suppose "ss" are empty<br>points).<br>Either White or Black must have finished his orbit first and for that<br>reason must have removed the opponent's stones inside before the<br>opponent could make his orbit. After that it is prohibited to place a<br>stone into the opponent's orbit, isn't it? You have two black stones<br>in White's Orbit and three White stones in Black's orbit. How do you<br>reach such a position??? Tell me which stone was placed last in your<br>given position and I will tell you why the position was illegal<br>according to your rules which say that all opponent's stones are<br>removed directly after an orbit is created.<br><br><br>TruthForum</div>
