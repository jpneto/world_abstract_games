    <div>First of all, thanks again for all the great<br>ideas you all gave me.<br><br>Secondly, I have a small<br>quandary, what should I call my game.<br><br>Oringinally I<br>called it The way, but I have since seen another game<br>called that which is totally different from what my game<br>is like.<br><br>So I have changed over to "the way<br>of go" after I added the rule that used the<br>liberties of a group to determine the distance a piece can<br>travel.<br><br>However I don't know if that name is the most suitable<br>name. So if you all have any ideas, it would be<br>appreciated.<br><br>Thanks in advance</div>
