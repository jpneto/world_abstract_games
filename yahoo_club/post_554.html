    <div>This sounds like it might be fun to try out.  Can you summarize the rules<br>for us?  I'm a little confused as to exactly what is going on.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Steve<br><br>----- Original Message ----- <br>From: "interrupt27" <llsmith@...><br>To: <abstractgames@yahoogroups.com><br>Sent: Saturday, April 17, 2004 10:17 PM<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: A continuous 1-D go game<br><br><br>> I've arrived at a title for this particular game, String Go. Very<br>> appropriate, since this is the general appearance of play.<br>><br>> One area of concern is the solid loop. Technically it could be<br>> considered a dead position since there are no liberties. But it is a<br>> necessary formation to encourage specific play. Therefor, it is<br>> merely considered a completed string and not subject to further play.<br>><br>> But these positions are difficult to obtain, if the opponent is aware<br>> of their possibility. Even the fractal loop is difficult. Often<br>> there is a form of interlacing of the various attempts. But these<br>> completed strings can create nice roadblocks, channeling play.<br>><br>> The rule that stones must be placed either adjacent or more than the<br>> width of a stone distance appears to play well. But the distance<br>> rule might best be described as "the width of one and one-half stone<br>> or greater". It makes the initial formation of a simple string of<br>> three stones difficult, and creates a nice dynamic to this non-<br>> uniform placement allowing for sufficent space between various<br>> strings. And placing a stone adjacent another stone allows for the<br>> necessary proximity to other strings.<br>><br>> In the opening, each player might place single stones around the<br>> playing field. Then there arises the positions whereby players begin<br>> placing stones next to stones, influencing the shape of play<br>> with the possible captures. Basicly pushing the formations toward<br>> each other, so that strings of three can be made.  Slowly, sections<br>> of strings begin to form. Play then begins to shift to completing<br>> these strings and capturing opposing strings.<br>><br>> There is another interesting formation where both players have a<br>> string with a fractal loop as an anchor.  These can be joined without<br>> either player suffering capture.<br>><br>> As to the advantage of the perimeter.  This can be thwarted with<br>> strings running from or to it.  A simple three-stone loop can cripple<br>> an opponent's attempt to circum-navigate the playing field.<br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>> --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>------<br>> Yahoo!
