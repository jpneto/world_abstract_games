    <div>[from stackgames group] <br>> I'd like to take a poll on how many people are relieved that Ralf is <br>> gone.  He had written a flattering article about me in Yahoo <br>> abstractgames.  Said article has now actually been removed, so I<br>assume that Ralf is moderator there as well.<br><br>The moderator of Yahoo Abstract Games is me, Jo=E3o Neto, and, until<br>now, I only deleted spams.<br><br>I just want to remind that we are here to talk about board games, and<br>if someone has some problems please solve them by email, not in these<br>public forums.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
