    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...><br>ease provide feedback.  <br>> <br>> Recently IAGO received a very strong venting complaint that it <br>> was going WAY off track, and was going to "ruin" the definition <br>> of what an abstract strategy game is.  <br><br>I never said IAGO was going to "ruin" the definition of abstract game.<br> Plastering that claim all over the Internet won't make it true.  What<br>little damage you're going to perpetrate, assuming your organization<br>ever gets off the ground, is to mislead some people about what an<br>abstract game is.  To start with, you're including in your definition<br>every game that anyone anywhere ever referred to as an abstract game.<br> If there's a reference somewhere citing Pin the Tail on the Donkey as<br>an abstract game, then it's an abstract game according to IAGO.  From<br>there you're using your inexhaustible free time to create bizarre<br>constructs to classify abstract games like IAR which has no relevance<br>in this particular galaxy.<br><br>With a name like International Abstract Games Organization you seem to<br>be posing as an authority on abstract games.  But you're actually only<br>using "abstract game" as a buzzword to draw people in and then<br>manipulating your "definition" to accommodate every popular game that<br>you think would further your agenda.  It's deceitful and yes it's<br>damaging.</div>
