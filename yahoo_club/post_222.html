    <div>> I would like to  <br>> describe another solution to the problem which is known in Germany <br>> for at least half a century:<br> <br>> "If one player has left his base, the other player must also leave <br>> his base (or move towards the exit of his base). Other moves are <br>> not permitted."<br><br>Thanks for that rule! I included it on the website.<br><br>> It's German? I recently found in a German gamebook that Chinese <br>> Checkers / Sternhalma was first popular in Sweden. So the game <br>might <br>> well be Swedish.<br><br>In TraditionalGames, it is stated:<br><br>"It was first patented in the West by Ravensburger, the famous German <br>games company, under the name Stern-Halma in Germany a few years <br>after Halma appeared.  It was later launched in the USA under the <br>catchier name of Chinese Checkers, and this is the form that is most <br>well-known today."<br><br>Are you sure, the game is Swedish?<br><br>Joao</div>
