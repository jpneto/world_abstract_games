    <div>Is there a level of organization of pieces in a board game complex<br>enough to force that game out of the category of "abstract strategy<br>boardgame" and into the category of simulation? And does adding a<br>little "chrome" to the descriptions of game actions take a game out of<br>this realm also?<br><br>Let's look at Go. Its pieces are little stones, covering 1 point of<br>the board, placed one at a time on the board. But, during the game,<br>structures arise, "eyes" or "fortresses". Go is an abstraction of a<br>battle for land, and some military connection still adheres to the<br>game, as well as the deliberate building of multi-stone structures. Do<br>these, or the fact that Go is a "territory" game, render it<br>non-abstract? Yes? No? Maybe just a little?<br><br>I'm not trying to start a controversy here, nor do I think that Go is<br>anything other than an awesome abstract game. But I wish to lay the<br>groundwork for some journeys further into higher-level and multi-unit<br>structures, with a bit of chrome in their description.<br><br>I design chess variants, and have been looking at some that try to<br>give more of the "feel" of military actions, or of battles between<br>fierce 1-celled creatures living in a puddle. This is the chrome. I<br>give pieces suggestive names, like "hero", "chieftain", or "brain".<br>The rules facilitate [or try, anyway] seeing a game as an abstract<br>military action or a group of pieces as an amoeba crawling and<br>fighting its way across the board. But the specifics of piece moves<br>are totally chess-like. It is the higher-level organization that<br>creates the effects. I offer two specific examples, and ask for your<br>comments. <br><br>The "military" variant is Chieftain Chess. All the pieces are short<br>range, moving 1, 2, or 3 squares at most per turn, and the board is<br>large. This is balanced by allowing more than one piece to move each<br>turn. The single king is replaced with a few chieftains, all of which<br>must be captured to win. There is a rule [the Command Control rule]<br>that a piece cannot move unless it is within 3 squares of a friendly<br>chieftain at the start of the move. A player may move as many pieces<br>each turn as [s]he has chieftains. Rules are here:<br>http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/chieftain-chess<br><br>The "primitive amoeba" variant is Chesimals 1, found here:<br>http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/the-games:chesimals-1 <br>It features multi-unit "pieces" that each contain their own leader, a<br>sort of "little king" that controls that group of chesspieces. The<br>leader's capture means that multi-unit piece is "dead". The Command<br>COntrol rule in this variant requires that every unit either touches<br>the leader piece directly, or is part of a chain of touching friendly<br>pieces that touches the leader. All 5-10 units in this giant piece<br>must stay in contact to move.<br><br>I'm working on more complex "amoebas", with a few "internal organs"<br>that can do things the current amoebas can't. Will a game that uses<br>these multi-unit chesimals as pieces be an abstract strategy game?</div>
