    <div>Hello,<br>That is very good question. In principle I should say<br>that any game including a random component should be<br>discounted as a Abstract Str. Game. HOWEVER the whole<br>purpose of 960 is to bring out pure strategic (cq<br>tactical) thinking in a game in which hard study is<br>such an important part of the way it is played. On<br>that count, and because the randomness is only part of<br>the initial configuration, perhaps it should be<br>included.<br><br>best<br><br>wilfried<br><br><br>btw: both chesses can be played at the excellent<br>http://64squar.es/<br> <br>btw2: check out my links at<br>http://socialfiction.org/?tag=psycholudology<br><br>btw3: the psycholudological manifesto:<br>http://socialfiction.org/?n=831<br><br><br><br>--- Rich Hutnik <docreason@...> wrote:<br><br>> This is Fischer's Random Chess.
