    <div>> Sternhalma (what you call Chinese Checkers) is an abstract game if<br>> it is played with two parties or players. This statement has <br>> nothing to do with (a lack of) "lifting up eyes". Coalitions <br>> cannot be part of a combinatorial game. Never! There is nothing to <br>> discuss here. It's a fact for game theorists.<br><br>Hmm. You quite shift from "abstract" to "combinatorial", from<br>"discussing" to "ruling" and from "definitions" to "facts".<br><br>As you mentioned the excellent book "Games of No Chance", see<br>game theorist Daniel Loeb speaking of "three-player<br>combinatorial games" in it and studying the resulting<br>coalitions. He makes it clear he is relaxing the notion of<br>combinatorial games on this precise point, but why not<br>saying he still speaks of "abstract games" at least?<br><br>Claude Chaunier</div>
