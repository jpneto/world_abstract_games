    <div>Ralf, this must be a proud moment for you!  You will now be forever <br>linked to the current leader of the free world by your colorful <br>contributions to the English language.  Unfortunately George W. Bush <br>coined "strategery" before you could, but "mythodology" isn't half <br>bad.  Mythodology could be interpreted as the systematic telling of <br>increasingly taller tales =96 something for which you are well known.</div>
