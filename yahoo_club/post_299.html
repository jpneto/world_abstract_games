    <div>> thank you very much for adding the rules of Tours to "The World of <br>> Abstract Games". It's a wonderful game (though I never heard of it <br>> before), certainly it is one of the best games ever invented! You <br>> mentioned that it was described in an issue of "Jeux et Strategie". <br>> Do you know when (in which year) and which issue?<br><br>I think it was number 39, I don't know the year (I just have some old <br>xerox), but it would be around 1985-87<br><br>btw, if anyone as a set of "jeux et strategie" magazines to sell, <br>please tell me!<br><br>Joao</div>
