    <div>Hello,<br><br> <br><br>I am really sorry, but there is a mistake on my site -<br>www.sweb.cz/klub-deskovych-her/pravidla/o-dama.htm . I have just noticed it.<br>The pictures are correct, the description is incorrect. And the English<br>translation is incorrect too. Here is the corrected version:<br><br> <br><br>Two players (White and Black) have armies of 21 checkers, arranged in<br><br>all the cells on the first 3 rows of an 7x7 board.<br><br> <br><br>Players decide who starts.<br><br> <br><br>A checker may move without capturing to any of the three<br>forward-adjacent vacant squares (diagonal or orthogonal).<br><br> <br><br>A checker may capture in any of the eight directions by means of the<br><br>short jump (jumping over an immediately adjacent enemy checker, to a<br><br>vacant square just beyond it). Multiple captures are allowed.<br><br> <br><br>There is no rule stating that capturing is obligatory or mandatory.<br><br> <br><br>There is no promotion. Checkers reaching the last row can still<br>capture or be captured, but cannot move otherwise.<br><br>The goal of the game is to block opponent's checkers. The player who blocks<br>his opponent wins. If none of them was able to block his opponent, the<br>player who captured more pieces wins.<br><br> <br><br>---<br><br> <br><br>There are more possible boards:<br><br>The board can be the size of 9x9 with 27 checkers for each player.<br><br> <br><br>Players can play with 33 checkers on 7x7 board or with 43 checkers on 9x9<br>board. Then the checkers are placed in the middle of 4 checkers, i.e.<br>between the two rows - 7 checkers on the 1st row, 6 checkers between 1st and<br>2nd row, 7 checkers on the 2nd row, 6 checkers between 2nd and 3rd row, 7<br>checkers on the 3rd row. You can see it on the picture -<br>www.sweb.cz/klub-deskovych-her/pravidla/pics/o-dama3.gif .<br><br>If the board is 9x9, then there are 9 checkers on the 1st row, 8 checkers<br>between 1st and 2nd row, 9 checkers on the 2nd row, 8 checkers between 2nd<br>and 3rd row, 9 checkers on the 3rd row.<br><br> <br><br>I hope i tis more clear now.<br><br> <br><br>Lada<br><br> <br><br>  _____  <br><br>From: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com [mailto:abstractgames@yahoogroups.com]<br>On Behalf Of markthomps<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Kavkaz checkers<br><br> <br><br>Here then is apparently the first English rendition of the rules to<br>Kavkaz Checkers, except that I may not have it exactly right. Thanks<br>Ralph.<br><br>Kavkaz Checkers. <br><br>Two players (White and Black) have armies of 24 checkers, arranged in<br>all the cells on the first 3 rows of an 8x8 board. White moves first.<br><br>A checker may move without capturing to any of the three<br>forward-adjacent squares (diagonal or orthogonal).<br><br>A checker may capture in any of the eight directions by means of the<br>short jump (jumping over an immediately adjacent enemy checker, to a<br>vacant square just beyond it). Multiple captures are allowed. <br><br>Capturing is obligatory, and a player must choose a move that captures<br>the largest possible number of enemy checkers.<br><br>There is no promotion. Checkers reaching the last row can still<br>capture or be captured, but cannot move otherwise.<br><br>A player loses when it is his turn and he has no legal move. It<br>follows that draws are impossible.<br><br><br>This strikes me as a "standard" checkers variant, the one novel<br>feature (certainly a significant one) being the lack of promotion.<br><br>Mark Thompson<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SPONSORED LINKS <br><br><br>Board<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Board+games&w1=Board+games&w2=Chess+boa<br>rd+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w6=Classi<br>c+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=D34M7A9QdPTRnHjhxpb2kA>  games <br><br>Chess<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chess+board+game&w1=Board+games&w2=Ches<br>s+board+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w6=C<br>lassic+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=7Bvm91j8kZ2EI3SKSRLPIA>  board game <br><br>Go<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Go+board+game&w1=Board+games&w2=Chess+b<br>oard+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w6=Clas<br>sic+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=aMNZi6zpD--34R1tOwzu7A>  board game <br><br><br>Monopoly<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Monopoly+board+game&w1=Board+games&w2=C<br>hess+board+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w<br>6=Classic+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=IoPBkINOwIqEtL7OuCNGUQ>  board game <br><br>Risk<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Risk+board+game&w1=Board+games&w2=Chess<br>+board+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w6=Cl<br>assic+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=foRWowgLGzq79QLWDsZHSg>  board game <br><br>Classic<br><http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Classic+board+game&w1=Board+games&w2=Ch<br>ess+board+game&w3=Go+board+game&w4=Monopoly+board+game&w5=Risk+board+game&w6<br>=Classic+board+game&c=6&s=128&.sig=WZAFLEdB9VFSsF5nMDRJjg>  board game <br><br> <br><br>  _____  <br><br>YAHOO!
