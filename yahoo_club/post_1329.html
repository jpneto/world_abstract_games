    <div>If Connect 4 is "solved" anyone have any ideas how the idea of a drop<br>X in a row game could review the basics of Connect 4, and make it<br>playable again?  I know I did Pethera-Tethera for Stonehenge, which<br>uses Gipf piece recycling, and is non-trivial.  Just curious what else<br>could be done with Connect 4 to revive it for tournament play.  Any ideas?</div>
