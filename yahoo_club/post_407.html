    <div>Gobblet is a draw in perfect play. After each player has put his three<br>largest gobblets on the board, no good player would continue to place<br>the remaining smaller gobblets on the board because they would be<br>captured immediately, in other words this would be a bad move. For<br>that reason players continue to move the large gobblets for ever. <br><br>RJG</div>
