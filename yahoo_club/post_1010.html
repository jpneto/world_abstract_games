    <div>Here's what you don't do:  You don't show up at Super Duper Games, <br>declare all of the games there to be "boring," and then try to <br>establish your intellectual superiority with bluster, belligerence, <br>and hysterical temper tantrums.  That's actually a formula to get <br>yourself projectile ejected with a nice, rosy boot print on your ass.  <br>(The fact that Aaron tolerated Ralf's shenanigans as long as he did is <br>testimony to Aaron's generosity and sense of fair play.)<br><br>Here's how you establish intellectual credibility in an abstract <br>gaming venue: You learn the games that are played there, you play them <br>hard, play them well, and you excel in the ratings.  Does any of this <br>make sense?</div>
