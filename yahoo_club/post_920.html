    <div>> You mean me or Mark Steere? <br><br>Mark Thompson.<br><br>> I have no idea, I didn't copy down the<br>> website and don't remember noticing that, or understanding it. 43 is a<br>> prime number, doesn't seem to fit the pattern. Maybe 4 rows on an<br>> 11x11 board with one left vacant?? <br><br>17x13 would fit, but it's not quadratic. BTW, they used to play a <br>variant of Russian Checkers on (10x8), even had tournaments.<br> <br>> Could 43 be a misprint?<br><br>Perhaps.<br><br>Ralph</div>
