    <div>This question goes right to the heart of my<br>interest in games. One can easily think up a bunch of<br>rules, but most of the time rules create a very weak<br>process, which is very dull. What makes certain rule sets<br>stand out, giving rise to what we think of as a true<br>"game" ?<br><br>There are really two questions: 1) What<br>is a game? and 2) How can we find new<br>games?<br><br>A very insightful answer to question 1) is offered<br>by J. Mark Thompson's "Defining the Abstract", at<br><a href=http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/game_thoughts.html target=new>http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/game_thoughts.html</a><br><br>So let's look at question 2). I can only offer<br>suggestions based upon my own attempts to develop new games.<br>In a game, each player must have a goal, and the<br>actions of each player must limit the choices of his<br>opponent. Of course there must be no "easy"<br>strategy.<br><br>What about symmetry with respect to each player's<br>options? I am not referring to easy strategies afforded by<br>the shape of a game board, which allow one player to<br>mimic the other. Rather, I am referring to the powers,<br>or options each player has. A no-luck game is never<br>perfectly symmetric, because one player must move first.<br>But it does seem that in most worthwhile games, both<br>players have the same power. In chess, players all have<br>the same selection of pieces (knight, rook, etc.). In<br>Go, both player place exactly one stone per move, and<br>all stones have the same power. The reason such<br>symmetry is common in games, is probably because it<br>minimizes the advantage of moving first or second; without<br>symmetry of movement choice, one player is likely to have<br>an advantage.<br><br>Another issue is interaction. A<br>good game should encourage interraction between<br>players. In some games I have thought of, it turns out a<br>player can do quite well by completely ignoring his<br>opponent. To put this another way, it ought to be<br>advantageous to be offensive, rather than defensive.<br>Aggressive strategy ought to be clearly superior to passive<br>strategy.<br><br>Another issue is clarity of goal. This is hard to<br>describe, but I will try. Of course, it should be difficult<br>to find a path to reach your goal. However, the<br>"location" of your goal should always be clear. Consider the<br>classic "5-in-row" game, Renju. Object: get 5 in row,<br>horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. It is always clear how<br>close each player is to this goal. Now consider this<br>variation: 5-in-row, in any straight line direction. It is<br>arguable that this variation makes it too difficult to<br>keep track of the goal. A player must devote all his<br>energy to simply to examine all possible straight lines,<br>so that he has very little time to plan much<br>strategy. The winner is no longer the cleverer opponent,<br>but rather the player patient enough to check every<br>straight line on the board. It is like "finding a needle<br>in a hay stack".<br><br>Another issue: "property<br>rights". I very much prefer games in which I own my<br>pieces. So I prefer games like chess and Hex over games<br>like Nim and Dots-&-Boxes. The reason is that you<br>can<br>gradually build up a working structure when you own your<br>pieces. Otherwise, your moves just get mixed together<br>with your opponent's moves. It seems to me, if you do<br>not own your own pieces, there is less point to<br>thinking ahead, or rather a game reduces to just counting<br>number of moves ahead. When players own their own<br>pieces, there is a dramatic contrast between playing<br>style, which becomes apparant as the game<br>progresses.<br><br>That is all I can think of at the moment. This is a<br>nice games club, but there just aren't that many<br>people with this interest. Oh well.</div>
