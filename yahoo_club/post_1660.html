    <div>This is kind of an abridged compilation of my Cage announcements in rec.games.abstract.  I almost gave up on this group as defunct.  Ralf Gering just about killed it with his Salta announcement back in July.  <br><br>SuperDuperGames adds MSG game, Cage.<br><br>http://superdupergames.org/<br><br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br><br>GamesByEmail adds MSG game, Cage.<br><br>http://www.gamesbyemail.com/<br><br>Thomas Plick has programmed Cage for download.<br><br>http://amecy.nfshost.com/cage/<br><br>The download is really the place to start with Cage, for a couple of reasons: First, just to make sure you understand the rules.  Cage is a little complicated.  There's the notion of the centering move, one which reduces the straight line distance between your checker and the center point of the board.  Sometimes it's not real obvious to beginners which moves bring them closer to the center.<br><br>Everyone has their own way of understanding centering.  You have to be cognizant of the two main diagonals and the center point of the board.  It becomes second nature after a game or two.<br><br>Another reason to play the download first is so you'll have a superior opponent, someone (the AI) who can show you some proper tactics.<br><br>There are a lot of parallels between Cage and Oust.  Both are violent games with very effective churning mechanisms, keeping the tension and the violence going until someone is inevitably wiped out.  Both are counter-intuitive in the sense that you should not kill everything within reach in the opening game. Comebacks are not unusual in Cage or Oust.  An army of one can wipe out an army of many. <br><br>-Mark<br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
