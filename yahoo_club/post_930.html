    <div>Come and join our Mancala Forum!<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Description<br> <br>This is a group to discuss board games of the mancala family. Mancala <br>games are a family of traditional board games which involve sowing <br>seeds in a series of holes in the board. These games have a long <br>history, and are played throughout the world. The most well-known <br>mancala game is probably Oware (also known as Warri and Awele), which <br>is particularly popular in West Africa and the Caribbean. Bao (also <br>known as Bawo) and Omweso are mancala games popular in East Africa. <br>Other mancala games include Congklak, Dakon, Sungka and Kalah. <br><br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/<br>Subscribe: Send a message to mancalagames-subscribe@yahoogroups.com <br><br><br>Recent Topics<br><br>- Photos of Ouril Players (Cape Verde)<br>- Upcoming Awele Tournament in Cannes<br>- Mankala Contests in the US<br>- Chess clocks<br>- Grand Slam Rules<br>- Diffusion - a New Mancala Game<br>- Condi Mancala<br>- Draws<br>- Mirroring<br><br><br><br>=</div>
