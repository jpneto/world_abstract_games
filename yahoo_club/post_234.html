    <div>Hi Dan and all,<br><br>> I don't see it.  When I followed your instructions I was left with <br>> four frozen auxiliaries on the first rank (b1, d1, e1, g1).  Am I <br>> missing something?<br><br>Oops, you're right! I think, however, I pointed to the right <br>direction. The goal was to re-arrange the player's pieces on his <br>first two rows<br><br>1. so that the opponent can't capture any of them<br>2. to do that without losing any pieces <br>3. to have at least one secure Auxiliary behind the wall (could be <br>called the "Berlin" wall) which can move back and forth<br><br>My "solution" fails in regard to (3)<br><br>which means: the player still must re-arrange the Auxiliaries which <br>stay behind the wall so that at least one of them can move.<br><br>An abbreviated solution would be:<br><br>Archer: c/d2-c/d3<br>Aux.: d1-b2<br>Archer: c/d3-c/d2 (left edge is protected)<br><br>Archer: e/f2-e/f3<br>Aux.: e1-g2<br>Aux.: g1-e2<br>Aux.: j1-f1<br>Aux.: e2-g1<br>Archer: e/f3-e/f2 (left center protected, the Aux. at g1 can later <br>freely move to k1 and back to g1, that is, back and forth)<br><br>Archer: k/l2-k/l3<br>Aux.: l1-j2<br>Archer: k/l3-k/l2 (right center protected)<br><br>Archer: m/n2-m/n3<br>Aux.: m1-o2<br>Archer: m/n3-m/n2 (right edge protected)<br><br>15 moves<br><br>This sequence can be protracted by the opponent, but not prevented. <br>The opponent cannot move an Archer to the third row, to block Green's <br>Archer of the same column, because he would be captured by the <br>diagonally adjeacent Archer in the next move. The sequence can also <br>played in a different order.<br><br>BTW, where are you from (which country / nation), Dan? Your games are <br>great and I enjoy them much.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
