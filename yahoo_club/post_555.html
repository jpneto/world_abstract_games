Of <br>course, it is just the "bare bones" rules and does not include any of <br>the tactics.<br><br>--------start of file-------------<br><br>STRING GO<br><br>Equipment:  A standard set of Go stones, 180 Black and 181 White.<br><br>The playing field is an open area of between 20 and 30 stones across.<br>It is not necessary that the area be of any particular shape, round<br>or square.<br><br>Each player, beginning with White, places a stone on the field under<br>the following restrictions:<br><br>The stone must be directly adjacent to another stone.<br>                  -or-<br>The stone is one and one-half stone distance, or more, from any other.<br><br>Each stone is consider to have exactly two liberites.  These <br>liberties can take place anywhere along their circumferences.  Thus <br>no stone will ever have more than two stones adjacent.  No stones on <br>the field may be moved to place another, there must be sufficient <br>space to make a placement.<br><br>A stone or series of stones which have had all their liberties <br>removed by opposing stones are removed from the field and returned to <br>their owner for subsequent play.  <br><br>Players may merge the end of strings, but not cross them.  A player <br>is allowed to form a continuous loop of their own stones.  This is a <br>completed string and is no long subject to play.<br><br>The player who is able to place their last stone, without the <br>opponent immediately preforming any captures, wins.  If the position <br>occurs where no stones may be legally placed, the player with the <br>most stones on the field will win.<br><br>---------end of file--------------<br><br><br>I hope that this is sufficient.  Let me know if there needs to be <br>clarification.  Also, let me know if there appears any serious <br>problems with the play.  Further adjustments to these rules may prove <br>necessary.</div>
