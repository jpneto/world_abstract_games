    <div>This is a Wiki entry.  Please be kind if you care to edit it:<br>http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/iago-abstracts-list<br><br>This is to be a recognized list of abstract strategy games by IAGO. <br>It has grown to try to cover everything abstract strategy out there. <br>Some games some of the off-wiki sites have a good chance for not<br>fitting the formal IAGO definitions, but they show a range of what<br>people consider to be abstract strategy games.</div>
