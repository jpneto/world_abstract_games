    <div>Thanks.  I am sure it needs some reorganizing and likely needs some<br>elements added as far as a forum goes.  As far as the association<br>goes, there is a LOT of work that needs to done.  I am hoping the<br>rubrics for what counts as IAGO abstract strategy games gets settled<br>at least.  Big debate over the extent of luck (dice randomizer and<br>hidden information) and also theming itself (and a bit on rules<br>length) were being hashed over.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, colin leamon<br><shinermonsgames@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I had a quick look Rich, it looks good!<br>>    <br>>   Colin<br>> <br>> Rich Hutnik <docreason@...> wrote:<br>>           For people who want to chat and brainstorm the<br>association, please<br>> visit and sign up at the IAGO website.
