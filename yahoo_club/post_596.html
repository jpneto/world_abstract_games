    <div>How about Arimaa? This abstract game seems to meet your requirements <br>and it's my favorite because of its depth and variety (your sense 7).<br><br>http://arimaa.com<br><br>Never mind the purple color and the objective -- to defeat AI -- <br>displayed when entering the site. Omar Syed's game is really worth <br>playing and studying.<br><br>Claude<br>(aka clauchau on Arimaa)</div>
