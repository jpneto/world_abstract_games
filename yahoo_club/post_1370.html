    <div>Mark,<br><br>I have a suggestion for a revised "Object of the Game"<br><br>current:<br><br>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>When the board is completely filled with stones, the player with the <br>majority of stones on the board wins:<br><br>proposed:<br><br>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>When it no longer becomes possible for one player to overtake the other <br>player in number of stones, the game ends<br>and the player with the majority of stones on the board wins.  If it is <br>not obvious that this has occurred, the game may<br>continue until such time that it becomes obvious that a win is imminent, <br>or barring that, the board is completely filled with stones.<br><br>The idea being that for most games it is pointless to play them out until <br>the board is filled.<br><br>Let me know what you think.<br><br>-- Greg<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Greg Schmidt <gschmidt@...> <br>Sent by: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>02/15/2008 12:45 PM<br>Please respond to<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br>To<br>abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>cc<br><br>Subject<br>Re: [Abstract Games] The game of Rush now public domain<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mark,<br><br>Well there may be a silver lining (although perhaps a minor one) in all of <br><br>this.

I had offered the exclusive right to program Rush to one<br>particular game site, the owner of which accepted my offer and<br>promised to implement Rush at her earliest convenience. Now after<br>nine months of extended delays, the owner of said game site has<br>reneged on her promise. <br><br>I've now rescinded said game site's exclusive right to program Rush<br>and I hereby release Rush into the public domain. <br><br>What a huge waste of time that was. The owner of said game site had<br>originally asked me to make my future games exclusive to her site. I<br>volunteered to make exactly one game, the next game that I would<br>design, exclusive to her game site in reciprocation for her promise to<br>program all of my existing games, which promise was also reneged on. <br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br><br> <br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
