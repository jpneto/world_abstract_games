    <div>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> What he said.  Men are simply more inclined toward abstract games than<br>> women.  At a serious abstract game site like SDG (SuperDuperGames.org)<br>> I don't know what the percentage of women is.  Probably around 10%.<br>> <br>> Now when you move to the larger game sites, where the limelight is<br>> shared with banana cream pie recipes, you probably have more women<br>> than men.<br> <br>I also want to add several comments here:<br>1. If you want to appeal to women, you focus on solving problems,<br>rather than beating someone.<br>2. Second, the reason for the world champion, and so on, is to be able<br>to come up with a spokesperson/icon for abstracts, that people can<br>relate to and act as a face to promote abstract strategy games.<br>3. Abstract strategy games ARE about competition.  They are about<br>beating people in a battle of the mind.  It is all about the<br>competition here, and that is a sales point.  If you to spin it as a<br>who is the brainiest, then people get bored.  You spin it as who is<br>the best of the best, and the challenges you overcome, then it works.<br> 3a. You want to get interest, you need to have interesting stories<br>people can follow, that is of interest.  I mean, take the movie and<br>graphic novel 300.  Who is normally interested in learning about a<br>battle where a bunch of Spartans go off to get slaughtered by<br>Persians.  That is NOT the story.  And for people not into abstracts,<br>the game itself isn't the story, it is the players and what they overcome.<br>Check out how a little spin can get someone interested in Go:<br>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/210058<br>4. If you want to draw women in, I would go with team play for<br>abstract games, so women can team up and do teamwork and cooperating.<br> This isn't normal to abstract strategy games, but can get there.</div>
