    <div>> Nice idea. I think, the game is a draw. All the games I played <br>ended <br>> in a draw. One player simply places his stones so that the other <br>> can't make a "pente", while at the same time he avoids a group of <br>> stones which can be captured. Just don't try to make a pente <br>> yourself, and you should be able to achieve a draw.<br><br><br>Hmm, are you positive you're not missing some captures? Lynn Smith <br>has now completed a ZRF that plays the game, and says he's played it <br>for hours against the machine with only one draw (by repetition) and <br>no stale games. Linear Keryo-Pente (in which trias can be captured as <br>well as pairs) may be the preferred form of the game.<br><br>Can you give an example of a drawn position, which I suppose would <br>mean the board is filled, has no un-removed captures, and neither <br>side has won?</div>
