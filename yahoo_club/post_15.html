    <div>Hi,<br><br>Every time I think of a new game,<br>checking for symmetry strategies is one of my 1st<br>concerns. In fact, it's not difficult to imagine a game<br>with it. So your question is a very good one. I also<br>believe that there is no symmetry, because of the<br>capturing rule. <br><br>Anyway, SCALUS is just on draft<br>stage, mainly because I still not played a game with<br>another opponent (just with myself, and that does not<br>count :-) <br><br>I tried to make the rules as natural<br>as possible, but it may have some flaws to correct!<br>A ko or superko rule, may be needed. Even a PIE<br>rule (1-move equalizer) should be needed, if there is<br>some killer 1st move. At this moment, I don't<br>know...<br><br>Thanks for your nice critic and good questions.<br><br>I<br>heard about Gess in an old Scientific American (it was<br>Ian Stewart that mention it, right?), I will check<br>out!<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Joao</div>
