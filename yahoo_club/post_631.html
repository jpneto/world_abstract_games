    <div>http://www.geocities.com/rythmomachy/main.html<br><br>http://aritmomachia.blogspot.com/<br><br>Inspired by the "Rythmo-machia" or "Philosophical Game" of <br>Pythagoras, the game was referred to by Wibold as "Ludus regularis <br>seu clericalis". However, it was also known as "Alearegularis contra <br>alea secularis". <br><br><br>It was played with a dice with letters instead of numbers, and a <br>board with the names of all 56 virtues arranged in squares around the <br>middle. <br><br>At the end of the book three different tables are given to play this <br>game, two with square boards to be played with dice, and one circular <br>board to be played as a wheel of fortune with a turning pointer in <br>the middle. <br><br>On verso of two of these tables explanatory text is present, and the <br>game is extensively explained in chapter 88 of the first Book, pp. <br>143 ff., and is further discussed in the notes at the end, on pp. 461 <br>ff. <br><br>The folding tables, size ca. 42 x 37 cm, were meant to be cut and <br>mounted to be played with, including the engraved figures of dice. In <br>text the list of names of the virtues, and the figures of dice were <br>given too. <br><br>The chronicle itself is of interest, written by the French historian <br>Balderic the Red, bishop of Noyon andTournay, as it gives numerous <br>accounts of scholarly reseach and curious details.</div>
