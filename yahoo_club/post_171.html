    <div>Since it uses cards, Key Whiz doesn't look like what I'd call <br>an "abstract game." One feature that makes a game "abstract" is the <br>absence of randomizing elements and the presence of "perfect <br>information" about the current state of the game.<br><br>That said, it is possible to have an abstract game using <br>cards. "Mate," described in Sid Sackson's "A Gamut of Games," is an <br>example. But that's because in Mate both players, before they make <br>any decisions, are aware of who has which cards, and this is not true <br>of most card games. (Also, Mate is played in two rounds with the same <br>deal, the players swapping hands between rounds, so that neither <br>player has a disadvantage due to bad luck in the deal.)<br><br>This is not to say that Key West isn't a fine game, of course, but I <br>don't think it falls in the "abstract" classification.</div>
