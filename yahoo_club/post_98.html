    <div>For anyone interested in chess strategy, Forchess<br>(a four-handed chess variant played on a regular<br>chess board with an extra set of pieces) adds a new<br>dimension to gameplay by doubling the number of players. It<br>is typically played in teams, where the strategy is<br>similar to chess, with the exception that each player<br>must defend his army on two fronts. There is also a<br>variant in which all four players compete against each<br>other. In this form, the strategy becomes political<br>(imagine a hybrid cross between chess and Risk).
