    <div>Hello all,<br><br>I have recently joined with the abstract games forum here.  I wish to<br>announce some new abstract games: GRYB and Time Vectors.  I would like for<br>you to view the games and rules and please let me know what you think about<br>them.  You may view them at www.gryb.com, and www.timevectors.com.  The<br>rules are downloadable in Adobe PDF format.  Any questions or comments will<br>be appreciated.  If you would like to review them for a publication, or a<br>games web site, please let me know.  I need your feedback.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Dave Barnhart [barneypaloma]<br>[mailto:davidb@...]<br>[mailto:davidb@...]</div>
