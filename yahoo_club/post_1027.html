    <div>Well put, Aaron.  Unfortunately though, it's all wasted on infant <br>Ralf.  Anything you say at this point, no matter how reasonable, <br>rational, and even handed, is only going to fuel the paranoid <br>conniption that has consumed Ralf's existence.<br><br>It's probably best to totally ignore Ralf at this point.  If he <br>becomes any more unstable, he might walk into his local <br>Weinerschnitzel and massacre some innocent frauleins.<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, Aaron Dalton <acdalton@...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>> Hash: SHA1<br>> <br>> I'm not sure you'll actually get this email because apparently you <br>added<br>> me to your spam filter, but here goes.<br>> <br>> I am confused and frustrated at so many levels, Ralf.  You are a<br>> published author, a man with no small education, a professed <br>Christian,<br>> obviously a man of no small intelligence, yet you have yet to <br>actually<br>> talk to me.  I have never said a single unkind word to you or <br>about you.<br>>  I have tried to be so totally balanced and kind.  Yet all I have<br>> received in return are single-sentence lash-outs and insults.  You <br>have<br>> actually hurt my feelings at a number of levels.  This week has <br>been<br>> more than a little stressful because of the way this has panned <br>out.  Do<br>> you realize that I and the other members of the SDG community are<br>> actually people, people with feelings, with families, with jobs and<br>> responsibilities, with education and ideas of their own?  If you <br>were<br>> angry and hurt about my decision, it would have been nice to <br>actually<br>> have a discussion with you.  Perhaps we could have come to some<br>> understanding.  As it is all you have done is meet me with <br>defiance,<br>> smearing my name and my hard work where ever you can.<br>> <br>> In response to your issue with Mark.  What you and Mark do outside <br>of<br>> SDG is your own issue.  That is not my jurisdiction.  I am in no <br>way<br>> trying to defend his behaviour, past or present (although I see <br>very<br>> little insulting in this most recent email).  I agree that <br>emailing you<br>> when you obviously don't want to hear from him is not exactly<br>> productive.  What you do not seem to understand, though, is the<br>> differences in your behaviour *at SDG*.  Within the space of one <br>week<br>> you managed to directly insult not just Mark, but no fewer than 3 <br>other<br>> members of the community.  Your tone disrupted everyone.  Mark has<br>> certainly had a few emotional bursts of rhetoric, but they have <br>never<br>> been directed at an individual.  His pride in his accomplishments <br>(not<br>> entirely misplaced I might add) has led him to make some remarks <br>people<br>> have not always agreed with, but as the forum records show, he has<br>> always been ready to apologize when necessary and has always been<br>> sensitive of other's personal feelings.  He has been a long-<br>standing and<br>> productive member of the community.  I am not about to start <br>banning<br>> people based on external activities.  Unless it jeopardizes the SDG<br>> family, I just can't get involved.<br>> <br>> Ralf, I don't know how to say this more clearly.  I have no hard<br>> feelings towards you.  I am not mad or angry.  Never have I tried <br>to<br>> directly insult you.  Never have I said an unkind word about you <br>on my<br>> forums, in my game chats, in my emails.  You are welcome at SDG.  <br>All I<br>> did was ban your posting privileges until we could talk further.  <br>Before<br>> you began to lash out at others, I was planning a private <br>intervention<br>> between you and Mark.  I only took the banning action after you <br>expanded<br>> your fight.  I sent you a lengthy email detailing why I felt I had <br>to do<br>> what I did and you refused to give me the time of day.  You have <br>given<br>> me no chance whatsoever to actually talk with you.  Anyway, your <br>life is<br>> your own and you are certainly allowed to do what you will.  I <br>only hope<br>> that if you choose not to try to reconcile with me, that you will <br>cease<br>> this endless attack on me personally and on a project I have <br>sacrificed<br>> greatly to create, maintain, and nurture.<br>> <br>> Most sincerely,<br>> Aaron Dalton<br>> Super Duper Games<br>> http://superdupergames.org<br>> <br>> P.S.  To the AbstractGames forum, I am sincerely sorry to have <br>bothered<br>> you with this somewhat personal posting.  Seeing as Ralf continues <br>to<br>> post publicly, I don't feel I have much choice but to respond the <br>same<br>> way.  I sincerely apologize for disturbing you and appreciate your <br>time.<br>> <br>> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>> Version: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)<br>> Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org<br>> <br>> iD8DBQFFS2PKvlYKTYgR0qQRAjApAJ9wB1syYnQL9m7NmDaLM1JNKtna6ACgogd0<br>> n+9TE3dty9MIy123DnI8dAE=3D<br>> =3DWxWm<br>> -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>></div>
