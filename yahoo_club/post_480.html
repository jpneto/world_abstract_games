    <div>It is quite difficult to make a new game, when there are so many games. There are many "similar" games, with one or two slight differences. Or a new game that is a mixture of 2 or 3 different games. I have studied several (about 40) games from Joao's list, and these things can be seen easily.<br><br>I think that the problem is that the new game is "slightly" different, so in reality it is a different game, has a different name and can have its copyright. For example Rolit is for 4 players and uses different pieces from Othello. So it is a new game.<br><br>Lada<br><br>  > Forgery --> Original<br>  > ---------------------<br>  > Othello, Rolit --> Reversi<br>  > Pente   --> Ninuki Renju<br>  > Pleiadis --> Glas Bead Challenge<br>  > Cats and Dogs, British Square --> Snort<br><br>  If these are copyright infringements, why doesn't someone get sued?<br><br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
