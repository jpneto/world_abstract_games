    <div>Phalanx is described in Abstract Games 11, page 10.<br><br>Drawing strategy<br>----------------<br><br>The game is dead (for serious competitive players) if it's possible <br>to move your pieces to a position where they can't be captured, while <br>it is possible to move a piece back and forth, if none of your piece <br>has been captured so far.<br><br><br>Solution:<br><br>1. Move the Archers forward.<br>2. Move the Auxiliaries just behind them forward along the diagonals <br>just one step (to the right or left). <br>3. Then move the Archers back to the initial position. (8 moves). <br>4. Afterwards you can move the central Auxiliaries indefinitely <br>sidewards.<br><br>The opponent can't stop you to form an inpenetrable line which each <br>piece being secure at the front line. If he tries to prevent the <br>drawing moves with one of his own pieces, it is captured and <br>afterwards the inpenetrable line is formed anyway (but now you win, <br>because you have captured pieces!).<br><br>A rather primitive game.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
