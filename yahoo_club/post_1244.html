    <div>Thanks for the reply.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>wrote:<br>><br>> No problem, Rich.  I'm kind of hung up on the "purist" interpretation<br>> of abstract games so I think it would be best if I just bowed out and<br>> let you handle IAGO as you see fit.  I just didn't want to see IAGO<br>> turn into a McAbstracts, but that's probably not likely to happen, and<br>> even if it did, it wouldn't have a huge impact on my life.<br><br>Well, if 90%+ of the menu is 2 player only combinatorial game theory<br>abstracts, and millions more are playing, and it is on TV (including<br>Dipole) regularly, would that be all that bad? :-) It isn't like I<br>want it to degenerate and become an association known for people<br>playing pin the tail on the donkey, or even poker.  I think we both<br>have concerns of total degeneration here, which I definitely don't<br>want to have happen.<br><br>> I guess the main thing is to remain civil, as you said.  Whatever you<br>> do, don't go the way of the gestapo.  There's a reason the vile Herr<br>> Hermann was the only member ever to be kicked out of SuperDuperGames.<br><br>I know you have concerns over the whole "governing body" and I<br>understand that.  It isn't to be a dictatorship, but everyone does<br>have a right to be concerned that things break down so that you get<br>people end up thinking just because it is a game, it is an abstract<br>strategy game.<br><br>>  I don't want to dredge up all the gory details here.  After all it<br>> happened a long time ago.  But at the same time, Herr Hermann's<br>> totalitarian legacy should be remembered lest history repeat itself. <br>> He's no longer a threat really.  Since being banned he's descended<br>> into the shadowy underworld of the sockpuppet, pitting his own aliases<br>> against one another in games of his own design that nobody else wants<br>> to play - to create the illusion of public interest.  It's kind of <br>> sad  when you think about it.<br><br>Well, if we didn't cool down, it was possible that we end up with<br>something totalitarian.  Seeing this recent shot at you had me feel<br>the need to chime in after cooling down.  We don't want a<br>dictatorship, but we do need to have identity here. All this gyrating<br>and waffling came out of this, and it appeared unsettled.  It is not<br>as bad as it appears. <br><br>So, I think it is best everyone play nice, play fair, play together,<br>and make sure that combinatorial game theory games get enough exposure<br>over time, so they get a boost beyond what is here.<br><br>Anyhow, I look forward to Dipole and the others ending up in the IAGO<br>World Tour.</div>
