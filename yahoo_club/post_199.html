    <div>I've been considering a one-dimensional version of Pente, played on a <br>circle with 19 points. (So I'm considering the circle as being one-<br>dimensional, since only its perimeter is the playing field.)<br><br>The object is to form a "pente," defined as a "line" of 5 stones in <br>which consecutive stones all have either 0, 1, 2, or 3 points between <br>them. Hence the last kind of win would have the pente almost <br>circumnavigating the circle.<br><br>Enemy stones can also be captured by forming a line of 4 stones, <br>consisting of two enemy stones sandwiched between two friendly <br>stones, and in which consecutive stones among the 4 have either 0, 1, <br>2, or 3 points between them.  (Then there would be Linear Keryo-<br>Pente, in which a line of 3 could be captured the same way.)<br><br>Anyone have comments, or want to try a game by email (or maybe using <br>Zillions)?</div>
