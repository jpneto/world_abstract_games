    <div>Steere is self-revealing. Pretty obvious that he is mentally<br>disturbed. He lives alone with his cats, his wife has left him, guess why?<br><br><br>> Hermann you have zero influence in the gaming community.  You have two<br>> games on one server only because Aaron was nice enough to add them for<br>> you.  Nobody ever plays them except you and your sockpuppets and<br>> nobody ever will, no matter how many more hundreds of times you revise<br>> them.<br>> <br>> You've been reduced to following me around on the Internet, sniffing<br>> my butt, and eating my crumbs.
