    <div>Hello All....i have been reading this site for quite a while now and<br>need advice for my new game. i say "new" but have been working on it<br>for a couple of years.<br><br>I have photos of the game in my album here in the photo section. The<br>game was inspired by the GIPF games and has good value components. The<br>board is screen printed on an 8" x 11" (20cm x 28cm)birch board and<br>has 3/4" (19mm) colored wood playing pieces and i added a screen<br>printed velvet pouch for the game pieces and for that day when the box<br>becomes too worn.<br><br>the game uses "common" pieces with two cubes and two cylinders of each<br>of the six colors. the goal is to become the first player to bear off<br>a cube and a cylinder of each color onto the spots on their side of<br>the board.<br><br>players take turns placing pieces on any point on the board. it does<br>not matter which color or if it is a cube or cylinder or the order<br>because no player "owns" any color or piece in the placement phase.<br><br>a player then "funnels" pieces towards their "home" square and then<br>off the board.<br><br>movement rules are simple. if two like pieces of the same color are on<br>the field of play, the piece may move twice. if only one cube or<br>cylinder of a color remains on the field, then that piece may only<br>move once. example: at the begining of the game, both red cubes are on<br>the field and player one may move a red cube towards his home square<br>twice. jumps are allowed as long as the spaces beyond are open so a<br>red cube with it's partner still on the board could actually move a<br>total of four spaces including jumped pieces. the same goes with<br>cylinders.<br><br>once a player gets a cube of a color off the board and onto one of the<br>square outlines on his side of the board, he may bear off a cylinder<br>of the same color using the same movement rules; [2 on the board-move<br>twice, 1 on the board - move once]<br><br>I have added a text file in the file section of the group with the<br>complete setup and rules that i include on my rules sheet.<br><br>MY QUESTION: Is there someone in the group who can help me jazz up my<br>rules sheet with example graphics? i have been to a couple of your<br>websites and really like some of the piece placement diagrams that a<br>few folk use.<br><br>also.....would this game make a good transition as an online play game?<br><br>i have only sold about 2 dozen of these over the past year and am<br>working on a page for it for my website http://www.acorngames.net <br><br>i have almost 100 games made up and want to think about going to the<br>next level but would like group input about how best to get this game<br>studied to find out JUST how good it is. i have tried to incorporate a<br>lot of what i have read on this groups message board about what makes<br>a good abstract game and think that i have come PRETTY close.<br><br>the duration is pretty short. those of us who play it a lot usually<br>complete a game in under 10 minutes.<br><br>common pieces with no ownership or set placement at the begining of<br>the game which makes for a lot of placement as well as movement<br>strategy which changes every game.<br><br>some players try to be logical in their placement so that they have an<br>idea of where they will place pieces to bear them off in a logical<br>order based on color etc. and by placing one of each color cube in<br>what they feel are optimal spots.<br><br>some players try to "mirror" their opponents placement moves so there<br>is no advantage(they think)<br><br>some play with the chaos method and just put random pieces anywhere on<br>the board and trust to their ability to judge which moves are best on<br>the fly. it can get interesting because you may see a move where you<br>can double-jump and bear a piece off the board but your opponent may<br>move off the twin piece of the same color and thereby spoil your<br>planned move.<br><br><br>i plan on this game being very playable for a long time and that is<br>why i went for the higher quality wooden bits and bobs rather than<br>cardboard and plastic.<br><br>also......i dream of a deluxe version with 1"(25mm)glass cubes and<br>cylinders in deep, jewel-tones and a rich mahogany board. anyone know<br>someone who could make the glass bits for me?<br><br>i WILL be bringing my wooden version with me to Origins Expo in June<br><br>please feel free to contact me off-list at chrisvnh@yahoo if you want<br>and there are a few people who i would be GLAD to hear from as to<br>where i can go to have the right people play my game and see if it can<br>win some award. i STRONGLY value what you all have to say on here and<br>look forward to hearing your opinions and advice.<br><br>Thanks very much - chriS</div>
