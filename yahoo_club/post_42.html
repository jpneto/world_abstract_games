    <div>Jianying, "The Way" alone was quite too arrogant<br>a name anyway,<br>if you don't mind my frankness.<br>"The Way of Go" sounds poetic,<br>modest and very open<br>to interpretation. I can hardly imagine<br>any<br>better name for your game. Maybe something more exactly<br>connected<br>to nice things occuring during the game could also<br>do, for<br>example about the concept of leverage, but<br>I don't find any nice<br>word for it.<br><br>But<br>look, there is something funny. What happens if we turn<br>the<br>game into a connecting game instead of a<br>capture-the-most game?<br>There would be a starting position with<br>many stones already on<br>the board, unconnected, on<br>opposite edges for example, and we<br>would not be allowed<br>to put new stones onto the board during the<br>game.<br>The moving and capturing rules would remain. The game<br>would<br>roughly be about moving your stones toward each others<br>and<br>gradually get them all connected. Now, the trouble is that<br>as<br>soon as you've connected n of your stones on an n*n<br>board, they<br>cannot move, since they would jump out of<br>the board. But the goal<br>is to get all your stones<br>in such a connection. Therefore the<br>game would<br>easily get into drawing or very cramped<br>positions<br>where neither player can go on. Now, I don't think it<br>was<br>invented through the same process, but there is a game<br>that can<br>be seen as a nice solution - define the<br>distance of move to be<br>smaller, namely you jump as far<br>as there are stones on the *line*<br>you are<br>jumping. And do you know how that game is called? A<br>sort<br>of synonym of the name of your game - "Lines of<br>Action".<br><br>It's another argument to keep "The Way of<br>Go".<br><br>Claude Chaunier<br><br>PS: I cannot write down all the<br>details for the 8x8 Game Design<br>Competition and maybe<br>you would disagree with some I would<br>neglect. I<br>didn't check this either but they say that if<br>you<br>have any questions about it you can post them on the<br>Board Games<br>Forum<br>at<br><a href=http://boardgames.about.com/games/boardgames/mpboards/htm target=new>http://boardgames.about.com/games/boardgames/mpboards/htm</a></div>
