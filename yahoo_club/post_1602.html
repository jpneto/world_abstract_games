    <div>Thanks for the tip, Matt.  I'll add that book to my list.  I'm working my way though Winning Ways now.  Well, actually just started volume 1.  I tried to read it 20 years ago but I just didn't have the patience.  Now I've got a lot more combinatorial games and a little more patience.  <br><br>-Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, burkemat <no_reply@...> wrote:<br>><br>> <br>> Not an answer to your question, but another place you might look for<br>> ideas about Flume theory is the work on Go that Berlekamp, Wolfe and<br>> others have done.
