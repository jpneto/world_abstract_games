I think Rich's idea was to have two separate lists: a list<br>> of abstract games in the strictly defined, traditional sense, and a<br>> separate list of games which don't really qualify but are "kinda like"<br>> abstract games.  I gave Rich the thumbs up on this initially but on<br>> second thought I think IAGO would be better without the "kinda likes".<br><br>I am going to post another message on here with the criterion.  As<br>someone pointed out, there is two aspects to "abstract strategy". <br>"Abstract" applies to lack of theme, and "strategy" to being based<br>upon player's cognitive skills (lack of luck).  As a result here, it<br>is standard vs non-standard.  The idea of the tight definition is so<br>that no one would disagree with it.  The definition for standard even<br>goes beyond games that are combinatorial game theory games, to even<br>exclude teams.  Non-standard is to allow for teams, or even some games<br>that have luck to them.  But it is tight enough to prevent morphing<br>into something else. <br><br>I will post the message. Please feel free to comment.</div>
