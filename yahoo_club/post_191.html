    <div>I agree that conventionally the term "abstract game" seems most often to<br>refer to games which are theme-less and do not include a chance element.<br>However it is unfortunate that the word chosen to define this is "abstract".<br><br> <br>From Webster's New World Dictionary, 2nd edition (and skipping the<br>pronunciation guides and the noun definitions):<br> <br>abstract (adjective definitions):<br> <br>1) thought of apart from any particular instances or material objects; not<br>concrete.<br> <br>2) expressing a quality thought of apart from any particular or material<br>object (beauty is an abstract word).<br> <br>3) not easy to understand;abstruse.<br> <br>4) theoretical; not practical or applied.<br> <br>5) designating or of art abstracted from reality, in which designs and forms<br>may be definite and geometric or fluid and amorphous: a generic term that<br>encompasses various nonrealistic contemporary schools.<br> <br> <br>   Definitions 1) and 2)  imply the theme-less aspect of abstract games, but<br>nowhere in the five definitions is there anything concerning perfect or<br>non-perfect information or any reference whatsoever to chance elements or a<br>lack of them (which occur both in real-life situations as well as in some<br>areas of mathematics and theoretical physics). Admittedly this is just from<br>one dictionary and not the biggest that Webster publishes, and if anyone can<br>find a definition of abstract that encompasses or implies the absence of<br>chance I would be interested in hearing of it.<br> <br>   Does anyone know where the term "abstract game" originated and how it was<br>defined at that time? <br> <br> <br>-Mike Schoessow<br> <br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: truthforum2001 [mailto:Peace_Panther@...]<br>Sent: Saturday, June 29, 2002 11:49 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Re: The meaning of the term 'Abstract Game'<br><br><br><br>Hi Mark,<br><br>I fully agree with you. Your argumentaion is the only logical one. It <br>comes very close to the definition used in combinatorial game theory <br>which I would take as a starting point and then just drop the <br>requirement that a game has always to be decided by declaring the <br>last player who is able to move the winner.<br><br>> the VERY BEST move. Hence, if two omniscient players were playing <br>> many matches of the same abstract game, and both were trying to <br>win, <br>> then either the first player or the second player would ALWAYS win. <br><br>or the game would end in a draw: This is proven for Oware and Teeko, <br>almost proven for 9-Men's Morris (Ralph Gasser didn't use the <br>official rules of the World Morris Federation) and English Draughts.<br><br>TruthForum<br><br><br>To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br>abstractgames-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br><br><br><br>Your use of Yahoo!
