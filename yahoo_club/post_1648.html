    <div>Mark, please remember that I recognized that Oust was a great game --- and not merely a good game --- from the very beginning.  I also encouraged you to put square Oust back on your website after you'd taken it off, noting that the draw position is highly artificial (*both* players would have to deliberately engineer it).<br><br>My advice to Simon: remember that one great game (though worth hundreds of good ones)  is also hundreds of times harder to invent.  I hope that you succeed in your quest to invent a great game, but if you only invent good ones please do not be disappointed.<br><br>Steve<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
