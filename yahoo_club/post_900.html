    <div>> Kavkaz (the latter occupied by Russia since <br>> the mid 18th century). <br><br>Oops, 1864 would be correct and they call their country Itchkeria.<br>BTW, has anybody played Kavkaz Dama. It's a Draughts variant without <br>promotion, with no draws, no ties, no loops and no stacks whatsoever. <br>And yet, a very good game!<br><br>Ralph</div>
