    <div>>It is already interesting to restrict the<br>splitting into only<br>>halves or quarters of<br>stones.<br><br>It feels that 1/4 fraction for square boards, 1/6<br>for hexes<br>and 1/3 for triangle boards (like in Y).<br>Any other strange topology,<br>with an average of N<br>freedoms, would get 1/N fractions.<br><br>>But I'm also<br>wondering if unrestricted fractions makes<br>interesting<br>>games. It may well turn out that only a finite subset of<br>them are<br>>needed to play<br>well<br><br>unrestricted fractions posses one problem, if you let 1/361<br>fractions<br>in go, isn't possible for the 1st player to create<br>an uncapturable<br>structure, or even fill the<br>entire board, without any suicide?<br>(it would depend<br>on the freedom concept - the next<br>subject)<br><br>===========<br><br>>Now what happens about life and death in fractional<br>Go? It's not<br>>clear to me yet, but it would be<br>nice if fractional games<br>>complied to the<br>following principles:<br><br>>1. The fractional moves<br>played instead of a single move can be<br>>thought as<br>consecutive or simultaneous the way it suits<br>the<br>>player, when it makes any difference.<br><br>in<br>principle, simultaneous is enough. Do you think is possible<br>for<br>some pieces may be dropped, capturing some others, and<br>then the<br>remaining fraction can be placed after the<br>capture, on those cells?<br><br>btw, I would write (it's<br>cleaner I guess)<br><br>x2 . x2 o2<br>. x2 x2 o2<br>x2 x2<br>o2 .<br>o2 o2 . .<br><br>where 'xn' means 'x/n', and<br>if you allow more than 1 piece on a cell, you can<br><br>also write something like '1x3' (meaning 1 + 1/3), so<br>'xn' is the same as '0xn'<br><br>[the capture rules<br>seem ok]<br><br>>For example, unlike normal Go, you<br>can add a complete stone to a<br>>complete stone<br>already on the board and make it a double<br>stone.<br>>Groups made of double stones are safe as soon as they<br>have got<br>>one eye.<br><br>would there be any<br>point to build a triple piece? It seems that<br>double<br>pieces are the larger stones still<br>interesting<br><br>There are some interesting tactics lying there:<br>For<br>eg., isolate a piece with four 1/4 fractions. That<br>way, to break<br>that, the other player must use three<br>1/4 to capture just one of the <br>1/4 piece, while<br>the other attackers stay there.<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
