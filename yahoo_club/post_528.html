In the case of Rome, the games were often played by the upper classes though, so color may have been more preference-based than in some cultures. As far as I know, black was also a very common color, and occasionally red pieces were also used, but much less commonly than white, blue and black.<br><br>  -Mike Schoessow<br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
