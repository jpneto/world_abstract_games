    <div>This message was posted to rec.games.abstract also, in an attempt to<br>see what responses people get.  I will also likely put it up on BGG. <br>Please respond here.<br><br>I have posted multiple messages regarding different aspects of<br>abstracts recently.  Anyhow, this discussion has resulted in what<br>appeared to be a need to spell out in more detail criterion for what<br>is or is not an abstract strategy game.  This was done so that IAGO<br>has a chance to function, by at least defining the scope of what games<br>IAGO will cover, and provide a criterion for accepting games under the<br>association without being too exclusive, or growing so large and<br>unstable that the association morphs into a general table games<br>association (causing abstracts to get lost).  While it is good to have<br>flexibility, if things remain too nebulous, all you do is end up in a<br>very minor niche that isn't sustainable.  Anyhow, this being said, I<br>have given more thought to the subject matter, and have this as a<br>possible solution.  It breaks abstracts into standard and<br>non-standard.  It seeks to put solid boundaries down, while allowing<br>sufficient breathing room.  Please comment on it.  And here we go...<br><br>http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/game-acceptance<br><br>[Criterion by IAGO of accepted abstract strategy games]<br><br>This document is covers the criterion by which a game is accepted by<br>IAGO and considered an abstract strategy game. This document is<br>currently a work in process. It is based upon the work by a J.<br>Thompson and the basis of his definitions of abstract article.<br><br>The predominant games of IAGO are combinatorial in nature (perfect<br>information, no chance, and playable by two players), along with some<br>other factors.<br><br>In addition, all games of IAGO involve pieces, that rest on a board or<br>as connected tiles, and have configurations of pieces, whose<br>positioning has a strategic impact. This means that card games, by<br>their nature, are excluded from games under IAGO.<br><br>To sum up, standard abstract strategy games for IAGO are based around<br>combinatory game theory, and other related factors that are described<br>below:<br>1. Perfect information all the time. Game does not require<br>memorization, or induction or deductive reasoning to figure out any<br>aspect of the play environment.<br>2. No chance element introduced (no use of dice, cards or dominos drawn).<br>2a. Definition of chance has to do with any element not controlled by<br>players in the game. Chance elements here besides the normal and<br>expected include randomized layout of player pieces or even randomly<br>generated asymmetric layout of board spaces. The only exception to<br>chance would be determining play order, provided both sides are<br>balanced and have near equal chance of winning. In cases where this is<br>not the case, the randomly determing play order is not accepted as a<br>random element in the game.<br>3. Move are alternatively, rather than simultaneously. This means no<br>hidden simultaneous turns selection by all players at same time, or<br>real-time where players act at same time.<br>4. Only two players. Not more than two players, not even as teams.<br>5. Skill at a game depends only upon a person's cognitive skills.<br>Elements such as the ability to read people, physical dexterity, being<br>political, size of vocabulary, or verbally articulate are irrelevant<br>to success or failure at standard abstract strategy games. Cognitive<br>skills involves such things as creativity, recall prior games with<br>similar positions, mental endurance, developing strategy, and deciding<br>which tactics are best. If a game requires any other elements besides<br>basic cognitive skills for mastery, then it isn't considered a<br>standard abstract strategy game.<br>6. Simplicty of rules. 2 pages maximum size for rules, 3 with diagrams.<br>6a. All rules involve the play mechanics and none of the rules in the<br>game are to account for chrome or theming. The extent of chrome or<br>theming may involve the game objectives, or the name of the pieces. In<br>other words, every rule for the game is for game play purposes, and<br>none for theming purposes.<br>7. All standard abstract strategy games involve pieces on spaces or in<br>a tiling manner (game such as Hive), and their relationship<br>positionally to one another is a basis for the play area. In other<br>words, all pieces are able to occupy discrete spaces that remain<br>consistent throughout an entire game (even if the space isn't visible<br>or on a board.<br><br>Note, at this present time, a game can be accepted into IAGO, as a<br>non-standard abstract if it deviates from, at most, one of the above<br>factors. If a game deviates by more than one, it is not an IAGO<br>recognized abstract strategy game (standard or non-standard). In<br>non-standard games with more than two players, political skills may be<br>difficult to be prevented to be used, which would lend a possible<br>exception to the only one deviation from the factors listed above.<br><br>In addition these are considered the measure of high quality abstract<br>strategy games:<br>1. Have Depth: Game is capable of being played at many different<br>levels of expertise. The best moves should not be completely solvable.<br>2. Clarity: Players can form a judgment about what is the best move in<br>a given situation, without the game requiring a career devotion to the<br>game.<br>3. Drama: It should be possible for a player to recover from a weaker<br>position and still win.<br>4. Decisiveness: A player can achieve an advantage from which the<br>other player can recover.<br><br><br>Please comment, and thank you for your time...<br>- Rich</div>
