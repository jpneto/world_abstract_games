    <div>Kindle is "Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device", essentially a tablet<br>computer with a cell phone in it.  You get one at Amazon.com, when<br>they get more in stock.<br> <br>http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA<br><br>Then you buy Kindle ebooks such as Joao Neto's "Mathematical Games,<br>Abstract Games" from Amazon.  The ebook is then downloaded to your<br>Kindle automatically.  There's no need to connect it to a computer.<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, colin leamon<br><shinermonsgames@...> wrote:<br>><br>> what is kindle? Are you saying buy the book?
