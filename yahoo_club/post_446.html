    <div>Hi Joao.  Having two kids who love games and a wife who doesn't,<br>I also yearn for the proverbial 3-player.  Do you like Triton aka<br>Shoulder to Shoulder?  Three-player hexagonal Chessgi might work.<br>Our favorite, is Kaliko aka Psychepaths.  Certainly not immune from<br>petty-diplomacy, but some would say that is intrinsic to a good<br>multi-player game :-)<br><br>Brainstorm: before the game starts, each player draws randomly<br>whether he/she plays to win, or to LOSE, and keeps the information<br>secret...<br><br>Best, -- William<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, joao_neto_1970 <no_reply@y...> <br>wrote:<br>> Hi<br>> <br>> I have been discussing and playing 3 player games with Cameron <br>Browne <br>> and Bill Taylor, and I wonder if some of you know any good 3 player <br>> games that prevent petty diplomacy problems and are enjoyable.<br>> <br>> You can check TRIAD, a Cameron's invention (or discovery) which <br>avoid <br>> quite well these tipical multiplayer problems<br>> <br>>    http://members.optusnet.com.au/cyberite/triad/triad-1.htm<br>> <br>> Cheers,<br>> <br>> Joao Neto</div>
