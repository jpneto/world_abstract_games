    <div>To those of you who didn't noticed, the "2004 Shared Pieces Game <br>Design Competition" has already a winner: Golem. You can check its <br>rules and other games at http://boardgames.about.com/od/sharedpieces/<br><br>Anyway, this contest has only partly related to our group, since <br>there are games with hidden information (like the winner) or with <br>luck elements...<br><br>However, within the realm of perfect-information, Tonga (2nd place) <br>may be transformed into a nice game (it also has hidden information). <br>I didn't check any rule set in detailed yet.<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Joao Neto</div>
