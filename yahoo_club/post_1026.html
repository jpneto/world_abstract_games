    <div>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA1<br><br>I'm not sure you'll actually get this email because apparently you added<br>me to your spam filter, but here goes.<br><br>I am confused and frustrated at so many levels, Ralf.  You are a<br>published author, a man with no small education, a professed Christian,<br>obviously a man of no small intelligence, yet you have yet to actually<br>talk to me.  I have never said a single unkind word to you or about you.<br> I have tried to be so totally balanced and kind.  Yet all I have<br>received in return are single-sentence lash-outs and insults.  You have<br>actually hurt my feelings at a number of levels.  This week has been<br>more than a little stressful because of the way this has panned out.  Do<br>you realize that I and the other members of the SDG community are<br>actually people, people with feelings, with families, with jobs and<br>responsibilities, with education and ideas of their own?  If you were<br>angry and hurt about my decision, it would have been nice to actually<br>have a discussion with you.  Perhaps we could have come to some<br>understanding.  As it is all you have done is meet me with defiance,<br>smearing my name and my hard work where ever you can.<br><br>In response to your issue with Mark.  What you and Mark do outside of<br>SDG is your own issue.  That is not my jurisdiction.  I am in no way<br>trying to defend his behaviour, past or present (although I see very<br>little insulting in this most recent email).  I agree that emailing you<br>when you obviously don't want to hear from him is not exactly<br>productive.  What you do not seem to understand, though, is the<br>differences in your behaviour *at SDG*.  Within the space of one week<br>you managed to directly insult not just Mark, but no fewer than 3 other<br>members of the community.  Your tone disrupted everyone.  Mark has<br>certainly had a few emotional bursts of rhetoric, but they have never<br>been directed at an individual.  His pride in his accomplishments (not<br>entirely misplaced I might add) has led him to make some remarks people<br>have not always agreed with, but as the forum records show, he has<br>always been ready to apologize when necessary and has always been<br>sensitive of other's personal feelings.  He has been a long-standing and<br>productive member of the community.  I am not about to start banning<br>people based on external activities.  Unless it jeopardizes the SDG<br>family, I just can't get involved.<br><br>Ralf, I don't know how to say this more clearly.  I have no hard<br>feelings towards you.  I am not mad or angry.  Never have I tried to<br>directly insult you.  Never have I said an unkind word about you on my<br>forums, in my game chats, in my emails.  You are welcome at SDG.  All I<br>did was ban your posting privileges until we could talk further.  Before<br>you began to lash out at others, I was planning a private intervention<br>between you and Mark.  I only took the banning action after you expanded<br>your fight.  I sent you a lengthy email detailing why I felt I had to do<br>what I did and you refused to give me the time of day.  You have given<br>me no chance whatsoever to actually talk with you.  Anyway, your life is<br>your own and you are certainly allowed to do what you will.  I only hope<br>that if you choose not to try to reconcile with me, that you will cease<br>this endless attack on me personally and on a project I have sacrificed<br>greatly to create, maintain, and nurture.<br><br>Most sincerely,<br>Aaron Dalton<br>Super Duper Games<br>http://superdupergames.org<br><br>P.S.  To the AbstractGames forum, I am sincerely sorry to have bothered<br>you with this somewhat personal posting.  Seeing as Ralf continues to<br>post publicly, I don't feel I have much choice but to respond the same<br>way.  I sincerely apologize for disturbing you and appreciate your time.<br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>Version: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)<br>Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org<br><br>iD8DBQFFS2PKvlYKTYgR0qQRAjApAJ9wB1syYnQL9m7NmDaLM1JNKtna6ACgogd0<br>n+9TE3dty9MIy123DnI8dAE=<br>=WxWm<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</div>
