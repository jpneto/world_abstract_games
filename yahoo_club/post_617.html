    <div>Hi Ron,<br><br>> Joao, I'm not sure, but perhaps Conquest and Feudal are <br>> what you're looking for.<br><br>Good tips, thanks! I've seen Feudal at AG11 and that's too muck alike <br>a chess board for a wargame :-)<br><br>However, Conquest seems interesting. I noticed that there are a <br>computer game to play it <br>[http://www.webstart.net/conquest/conquest.zip] where it shows the <br>rules.<br><br>But Conquest also has a simple capture by replacement (like in Chess) <br>which in a wargame does not see fair (infantry should have less <br>strength than cavalry). I guess that using Diplomacy mechanism (each <br>army has a strength that can be used to support other units to <br>attack) seems a very promising way create a diceless game.<br><br>Joao</div>
