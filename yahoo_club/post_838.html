    <div>Hi Joao,<br><br>thank you for your explanations. I tried your game, but there are <br>still several things which I don't understand:<br><br>1.<br>You say:<br>"A player cannot make two consecutive sideway moves."<br><br>But he is permitted to make two consecutive sideway piling moves or <br>capturing moves or first a sideway move, then a sideway piling, then <br>a sideway move ...? Isn't he?<br><br><br>2.<br>You say: <br>" If a stack reaches the last row, (...)  If it has prisoners, it <br>restarts at the first row on that column, and all enemy tokens are <br>removed."<br><br>Although this might be very rare, it can happen that the square at <br>the first row of that column is already occupied. What do you do in <br>such a situation? <br> <br><br>BTW, did you try to play AP just on one color of a checkered board <br>(e.g. 9x9 or 9x11; with nine pieces for each player)?<br><br>Ralf<br><br><br>----------<br><br>Rules:<br><br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/abpuluc.htm</div>
