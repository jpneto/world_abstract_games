    <div>> There's a line at the bottom of the preview that asks: "Are you sure<br>> you want to send this message?" No, I'm not, but I will anyway, hoping<br>> [against all hope?] that I will just get a reply dealing with mutators.<br><br>well, you'll get one post just about mutators :-)<br><br>> I'm interested in mutators, and get the idea that "mutator" is just<br>> another name for "game rule". Is this the case? In chess variants,<br>> mutators can change any variant into any other, so is there really a<br>> difference between a mutator and a rule [other than the spelling and<br>> pronunciation]? <br><br>Yes, mutators is basically a game rule, but with enough flexibility<br>that it can be used, a bit like a function, to transform a game into<br>another game. Most (all?) mutators are not universal functions<br>(meaning, they don't work with all games) but some are very flexible.<br>One of those is the PIE rule.<br><br>The main idea of mutators is to provide the game designer with a set<br>of tools to define or refine his game project. <br><br>Chess variants was the first game set I considered, but they also work<br>in other abgames. In Sagme's blog you can find dozens of games that<br>appeared basically by mutator manipulation.<br><br>>My original question was: "can gameboards be mutators?"<br><br>you mean, like the 8x8 board? I tend to separate the hardware (board,<br>pieces...) from the software (rules/mutators). Sure, a certain<br>material can provide inspiration for new rules, but usually I try to<br>think of an idea first and get the hardware as needed.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Joao Pedro Neto</div>
