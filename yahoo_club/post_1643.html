    <div>Hi abstract game folks,<br><br>I am a would-be game designer with a lofty goal: I want to make a game that<br>1) is so deep and worthy of study that it will be played for centuries to<br>come (like Chess & Go) and 2) is aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>I seem to have more talent with the second part of my goal than the first.<br> Sadly, that's less important.  I have made several prototypes and gotten<br>feedback (bggcon<br>proto-alley<http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/445402/proto-alley-at-bgg-con-2009>was<br>super-helpful),<br>but I've not yet come up with anything worthwhile.<br><br>Lately, I've been trying to come up with a good answer for this question:<br>"Why is Chess worthy of study?" Feel free to replace Chess with your<br>favorite abstract strategy game. What I really want to find are some<br>eloquent, simple answers.  Perhaps they will help give me something to aim<br>for with my own game designs.  Are any of you willing to take a stab at<br>answering that question?<br><br>Or if you know of eloquent answers online or in books, please share those.<br> Perhaps an easier way to answer the question is to try and list some<br>characteristics of games that are worthy of study.  That answers more the<br>what question, but perhaps it will lead to answers about the why question...<br><br>Thanks!<br>Simon Dorfman<br><br><br>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>
