A stack fuctions uniquely and independently as a single unit in Checkers.  It's not like the second story is used for spare checker storage.  If you're going to convince this native English speaker that Checkers is not a stacking game, whoa..  lol  You've sure got your work cut out for you, Christian.<br><br>Yes, stacks in Checkers are limited to a height of two, and must be comprised of like colored checkers. And a stack can be represented instead by flipping over a singleton and showing the crown side.  So what??  Every stack in every stacking game can be represented somehow with out using actual stacks.<br><br>Checkers is the original stacking game.  If you're proposing some definition for stacking that requires stacks to be taller than two, or have mixed colors or whatever, count me out.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
