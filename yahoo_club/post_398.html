    <div>> I will add Moxie Plus Plus to my list if you<br>> have no objections. <br><br>Sure, no objection.<br><br>> Also, what do you think of [Aera] as a game? <br><br>Never played it.<br><br>> I'm not clear on what you mean by "move is determined by the numeric<br>> sequence". Does this mean that piece 1 must be moved first, <br>followed by the<br>> next higher surviving piece on the player's next move, etc.? <br><br>If the players are Red and Blue, then Red drops 1, then Blue drops 1, <br>then Red drops 2, then Blue drops 2, (etc.), and after Blue drops 6, <br>then Red relocates 1, then Blue relocates 1, then Red relocates 2, <br>then Blue relocates 2, etc.<br><br>The original pieces, according to the review, were not numbered: <br>the "1" was a tile showing a circle, the "2" was an oval, and "3" -<br> "6" were regular polygons with that number of sides. (So think of a <br>circle as 1-sided, oval as 2-sided. Probably the oval had pointed <br>ends.)<br><br>> I take it that scoring lines must be four pieces? Also what happens <br>after a<br>> line is formed and a point earned; does the line of pieces remain <br>on the<br>> board and the other player then takes his turn and the game <br>continues? <br><br>Right, a line of 4: should have explained that better. As far as I <br>know, play continues uninterrupted. I assume a line only scores when <br>it is first made.</div>
