    <div>Thank you for the update, Ola.  A link verifying your claim:<br><br>http://www.educationallearninggames.com/pylos-game.asp<br><br>Since Gigamic had a contract allowing them to do what they wish with Pylos,<br>it obviously is not plagiarism.  I apologize for jumping to that<br>conclusion.<br><br>I suppose it's possible that once Gigamic had the rights, they made<br>unfavorable changes to the game.  But that would presumably be their right<br>under the terms of the contract.  If that's the case, I'm not too thrilled<br>with that process, but business is business, and it's not nearly as<br>distasteful as unauthorized copying with modifications.<br><br>Mark<br><br><br>On 3/14/06, unic <unic@...> wrote:<br>><br>> It's hardly plagiarism if the designer makes a new version of his own game<br>> - David G.
