    <div>This is one of those terms which has been bandied about for years and <br>many have varied definitions for it.  And can be a great topic for <br>further discussion.<br><br>Are random elements forbidden in abstract games?<br><br>What are the allowed pieces for an abstract game?  Tokens, tiles, etc.<br><br>Must the abstract game be played upon particular fields?<br><br>I know of several games which I would term 'abstract' which would <br>stretch the preceeding questions.<br><br>There are various games which utilize dice.(i.e. Hounds and Jackals)  <br>Some even cards.(i.e. Risk)  Others have no established field of play.<br>(i.e. Trax)<br><br>Let us agree that abstract games should challenge the mind.<br><br>If there are random generators in a game, these should not be the <br>only determining factor of play.  The player must make some form of <br>choice, some decision during the play, or else the game is merely <br>subject to luck and a game of chance.</div>
