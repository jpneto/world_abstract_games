    <div>Years ago, I came across a little book which transformed the way I <br>looked at the world and games.  I cannot say this of many books.<br><br>It was both enjoyable and thought-provoking.  And it still influences <br>me.<br><br>This book was "Finite and Infinite Games" by James Carse.<br><br>It is basically a philosopical dissertation about the nature of the <br>Universe.  That it is an infinite game divided into finite ones.  We <br>are all playing finite games, and while playing we participate in an <br>infinite game.<br><br>Within our finite games, we have established rules, rewards and <br>penalties.  These can be both changing and non-changing.  All decided <br>by mutual agreement or settle by aggressive competition.<br><br>There is much more.  I recommend this particular book to everyone.  <br>You will not be disappointed by its content.</div>
