    <div>Hello, I'm new to this group.  There's something I've been wanting <br>to get off my chest regarding strategy games, and I thought this <br>would be as good a place as any.<br><br>First, a little background.  I have a friend who is a big Star Trek <br>fan.  The other day we were discussing an episode of "The Next <br>Generation" that focuses on a strategy game.  In it, a grandmaster <br>of the game is visiting and the android, Data, challenges him to a <br>match.  Data, who is in effect a living computer, is surprised when <br>the grandmaster manages to beat him.  Data then challenges him a <br>second time.  After playing for a bit, the grandmaster becomes <br>increasingly frustrated and ends up leaving in a huff.  Data then <br>reveals his "winning strategy."  Instead of playing to win, he has <br>deliberately set off to force the game into a draw.  My friend said <br>next time we played a game, he wanted to try that strategy out on me.<br><br>But let's think about this for a bit.  This kind of play reminds me <br>of an old slapstick routine.  A little guy enters a boxing match <br>against a big guy.  When the bell rings, instead of exchanging <br>punches, the little guy runs away and the big guy chases after him.  <br>Rather than a fight, the two run in circles around the boxing ring.  <br>Now, from a strictly technical standpoint, the little guy has <br>achieved the same thing that Data did, forcing the game into a draw <br>by deliberately setting off to do so.  But in reality the whole <br>situation is absurd, because no one would ever hold a match like <br>this.<br><br>The essence of gaming is competition.  When players enter into a <br>match, there is an implicit agreement that all sides are playing to <br>win to the best of their abilities.  If, instead, there was a player <br>who deliberately set off to force the game into a draw they would be <br>failing to perform their role and degrading the game for the other <br>player.  They would be going against the very spirit and nature of <br>gaming itself.<br><br>Let's face it, if you set down to play a game of Halma with someone, <br>and all they did when it was their turn was to shift the exact same <br>piece back and forth, you would get up and leave in disgust.  Not <br>because of any brilliant strategy on their part.  Not because the <br>other player is insightfully exploiting an inherent flaw in the <br>game.  But for the simple fact that the guy is being a jerk.</div>
