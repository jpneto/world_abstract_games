Take a very good clock and you'll see that the moves <br>are not simultaneous.

Leistiko, 2003)<br>>E, the Game of Martian Chinese Checkers (Carol Townsend, 2004)<br><br>These are not true stacking games! Physically they appear like stacks, but <br>topologically they aren't. These are games where you just have multiple <br>pieces on one position.<br><br>>Outside the world of Icehouse games, Bruno Faidutti invented a simple<br>>stacking game called Pilade in 1993, which was published as Babylone<br>>in 2003.  Bruno's page about this game mentions one other stacking<br>>game not on your list: Stapel (CornAi van Moorsel, no date given).<br>><br>>http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=mesjeux&id=323<br><br>Both are true stacing games. Thank you!<br><br>>Greg Lam designed an abstract strategy game named Rock, Scissors, Paper<br>>in 2001.  One kind of piece (paper) can be stacked.<br>><br>>http://www.pair-of-dice.com/games/rsp.html<br><br>Whose color? Only your own pieces?<br><br>Ralf</div>
