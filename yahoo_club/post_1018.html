    <div>This is what I found in the English Wikipedia about Mark Steere:<br><br>Mark using three sockpuppets in the English language Wikipedia<br>(Advocron, CluePuppet, PearlMcPurry):<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive50#MarkSteere<br><br>Mark using two 'normal' e-mail accounts and three sockpuppets to<br>harrass the German anthropologist R. Gering (PrestonShepper, Lily<br>Hammer, Freckles Z Deutsch) and sending him Nazi propaganda:<br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/abstractgames/message/916<br><br>Mark: "priding oneself on how many edits one has conducted is like a<br>terrorist priding himself on how many buildings he has blown up."<br>(directed at a well-known Spanish games expert)<br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/message/1305<br><br>Mark insulting a social science scholar on Super Duper Games telling<br>him that he is suffering under "pseudo intellectualism" [sic!] and<br>"megalomania". [Note: not Mark was banned for this behavior, but the<br>scholar) http://forums.superdupergames.org/viewtopic.php?t=3D434<br><br>Mark insulting users in the deletion review calling them "deletion<br>yahoos" and was in return called "dishonest, incompetent, and<br>fanatical" and "Mister Textual Analysis". It was then recommended to<br>him to look up "psychological projection" and (...) "narcissism":<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3DWikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_3&diff=3D62522110&oldid=3D62400796<br><br>Mark claiming that all Germans are Nazis (and the public response):<br>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking-games/message/183<br><br>(Mark also promoted racist stereotypes in regard to Russians and<br>played down the Holocaust.)<br><br>See also: NPD<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Disorder</div>
