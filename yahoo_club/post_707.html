    <div>Is Dvonn (not in Browne's book)a connection game?<br><br>(Stones must be connected to a Dvonn stone, otherwise they are dead <br>and removed from the board.)<br><br><br>Are Trax and Havannah "Pure Connection Games" (C. Browne)?<br><br>(Should these two games rather be called cross-overs (a classic <br>term), because you can also win by forming a circuit (and are, for <br>that reason, not pure games but bastards)? Pure pattern forming games <br>(e.g. Cyclo, Hexade, and Olix) were not included.<br><br>> and "Connections" (Tom McNamara, 1977), a <br>> variant of Bridg-It (not the same game as erroneously stated on <br>page <br>> 160), but much deeper and, in fact, one of the most successful <br>> connection games ever marketed. <br><br>McNamara's game, properly called 'Connections', was briefly mentioned <br>on page 161. While patented much later (1993), it was already <br>invented in 1977. It reached the American market in 1992, where more <br>than 500,000 games were sold within the first year. It is used in <br>Japanese schools to teach children logic. In 2001 the Institute of <br>Informatics at Leipzig University organized a programming contest <br>that led to a renewed interest in the game of Connections.<br><br>Perhaps it will be possible to publish a supplement to Browne's book <br>later (similar to the "Encyclopedia of American Religions").<br><br>Ralf</div>
