    <div>I thought of a possible Pente variant the other day, which I think<br>would probably be playable and would probably reduce the first player<br>advantage. My working title is "Knight Pente". (Or maybe "Ritter Renju"?)<br><br>The idea is simple. The first player places a stone in the center of<br>the board. After that, every stone must be played a knight's move from<br>some stone (friendly or not) already on the board.<br><br>I would probably allow captures of either 2 or 3 or maybe even 4<br>stones in a straight line. Even getting 4 in a row could be somewhat<br>challenging, though, so that might be the object in a shorter variant.<br><br>This needs testing, but the idea attracts me. Maybe others would also<br>like to try it out.<br><br>-- Mark Thompson</div>
