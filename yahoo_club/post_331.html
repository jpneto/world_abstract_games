    <div>I'm glad you liked the Orbit article.  The puzzle at the end is <br>pretty fun to work through, if you've got some extra time to kill.<br><br>According to Mr. Schmittberger (p.66), Rosette was invented in 1975.  <br>It's played on a hexagon-shaped array of hexagons, with 7 hexagons <br>per side (127 total).  (Of course, play takes place on the <br>intersections of the hexagons' lines --- I'm not sure how many <br>intersections that works out to.  The game could alternatively be <br>represented as taking place inside the triangles of a hexagon-shaped <br>array of points, but it probably looks nicer the way it is.)<br><br>It occurs to me that there probably aren't a whole lot of games out <br>there that use 120-degree space.  Rosette is the only good example I <br>can think of offhand that does.  Surely there are others?<br> <br>Steve</div>
