    <div>Responding to Mark Thompson, and completely changing the subject, <br>there is an attractive tesselation called Cairo available at his web <br>site at http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/cairo_puzzles.html . <br>This tiling was used in a version of Blobs released at Zillions of <br>Games last weekend, and I am currently trying it out in an e-mail <br>game (I'm winning ... wait, I'm losing ... wait ...). There are also <br>some puzzles based on this design at Mark's site.<br><br>So, poll question: What other single-shape tilings have been used in <br>boardgames? There's square, hex, and triangle of course, but are <br>there others?</div>
