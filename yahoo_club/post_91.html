    <div>Hello,<br><br>Here goes some more information<br>about the game of Gonnect. Below, there is a resume and<br>some useful<br>links!<br><br>**********************<br><br>GONNECT<br>Joao Neto and Cameron Browne<br><br>Gonnect is a new<br>abstract connection game. It uses the basic rules of<br>Go<br>(each player drops a stone into an empty cell in turn;<br>stones with no<br>liberty are captured; there are no<br>suicides; players cannot repeat the<br>previous board<br>position) with the simplification that players may not<br>pass.<br>Gonnect also has a much simpler winning condition: a<br>player wins by<br>connecting a group of their stones<br>between any two opposite edges of the<br>board (or the<br>adversary has no valid move). Play usually takes place on<br>a<br>13x13 board.<br><br>Gonnect approaches both Go and Hex<br>in feel. It can be said that Gonnect is<br>the<br>middle road between these two great games, but after<br>being introduced<br>to Gonnect the curious player<br>begins to feel that it's much more than that!<br>Each<br>game emphasises several fighting themes as it<br>progresses: connection<br>races, blocking the opponent by<br>striving for local and global deadlocks,<br>then resolving<br>global deadlocks in the endgame by destroying the<br>opponent's<br>territory.<br><br>A mini sample of deadlock situation is shown below.<br><br><br>- x x o o -<br>x - x o - o<br>x x x o o o<br>o o o<br>x x x<br>o - o x - x<br>- o o x x -<br><br>Both<br>players have reached an impasse that precludes direct<br>connection.<br>However the "no suicide" and "no pass" rules combine to<br>resolve such<br>deadlocks beautifully - the next player<br>to move is forced to play in one of<br>their own<br>eyes, rendering that group vulnerable. The opponent may<br>then<br>capture the group next turn to establish an unbeatable<br>position.<br><br>Gonnect can be played on Richard Rognlie's game<br>server<br>[<a href=http://www.gamerz.net/~pbmserv/gonnect.html]. target=new>http://www.gamerz.net/~pbmserv/gonnect.html].</a> <br>Some notes and playing tactics gathered by<br>players [available<br>at<br><a href=http://sites.uol.com.br/vascog/gv] target=new>http://sites.uol.com.br/vascog/gv]</a> give the feeling that Gonnect has a lot<br>to<br>offer. There will be an article talking about the game<br>on the <br>Abstract Games Magazine N.6<br><br>The<br>following mini puzzle gives a taste of Gonnect:<br><br> A B<br>C D E F G H<br><br> 8 x - x - o - o - 8<br> 7 - x x<br>- o o o o 7<br> 6 x x x x o - x x 6<br> 5 - - x o x<br>x - x 5<br> 4 o o x o o x x - 4<br> 3 o x x o - o x<br>x 3<br> 2 - - - o o o o o 2<br> 1 - o - - - - o -<br>1<br><br> A B C D E F G H<br><br>X to move and win.</div>
