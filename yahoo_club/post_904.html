    <div>> Yes, I've heard that. Here in the USA it's difficult to find a<br>> good-quality checkered board in anything but good ol' 8x8<br><br>The same is true for Germany. A good friend bought me a marvellous <br>10x10 board in Paris, France, 20 years ago. I made a 12x12 board <br>myself to play French Canadian Draughts and then visited some Tamil <br>refugees in a refugee camp, just to learn that they also know this <br>game. This was long before the internet existed. <br><br> <br>> I was in Detroit once and made a special (but short) trip to Windsor<br>> (Canada) in the hope of finding a game store where I imagined I <br>> might find a 12x12 board, since Canadian checkers is supposed to be <br>> 12x12.<br><br>Only in Qu=E9bec. I have two books from Canada about 12x12 Draughts in <br>my private library. They contain beautiful endgame problems.<br><br>> > It becomes even more difficult to define <br>> > Draughts when it comes to modern variants. <br>> <br>> True, like your own Sleeping Beauty. <br><br>It's a fairly conservative variant which can be played on an ordinary <br>8x8 checkers board.<br><br>There is a long history of hexagonal checkers, asides from Christian <br>Freeling's game:<br><br>Russian Hexagonal Draughts (several variants):<br>http://azartgames.gambler.ru/Chekers/Chekers.htm<br><br>Polish Hexagonal Draughts:<br>http://www.warcaby.beep.pl/wheksa.html<br><br>What about cross-overs?<br>Schachdame (an old German game) and Cheskers (by Professor Golomb)<br><br>I also like Draughts variants with different pieces:<br>Damate, Dragon, Scoundrels, Stredoveka bitva (a Czech game)<br><br>Not to forget:<br>Desertion (by Professor Truran) and Gorgon (the variant with <br>compulsory capturing).<br><br>Have fun,<br><br>Ralph</div>
