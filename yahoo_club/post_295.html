    <div>Hi Joao (and all),<br><br>thank you very much for adding the rules of Tours to "The World of <br>Abstract Games". It's a wonderful game (though I never heard of it <br>before), certainly it is one of the best games ever invented! You <br>mentioned that it was described in an issue of "Jeux et Strategie". <br>Do you know when (in which year) and which issue?<br><br>BTW another interesting game described by Joao recently is Jumping <br>Beans invented by Chris Huntoon.<br><br>Joy and Peace,<br><br>TruthForum</div>
