    <div>Some years ago, I read an article that said<br>something like Chess having between 10 and 20 different<br>playing levels, and Go more than 30.<br><br>In the same<br>article, they defined that a player is above another by<br>one level, if at every 3 games, he would win 2. So, a<br>2 level player difference would mean 7 out of 9<br>games, and so on...<br><br>[In general terms, a player N<br>levels above another would win a fraction equal to<br>1-(1/2)(2/3)^n]<br><br>I wonder if this type of definition is interesting<br>and it may be found to some set of abstract games,<br>besides empirical data (like the ELO rating of<br>FIDE)<br><br>I mean, how many levels are between the worst<br>player (random play?) and perfect play?<br><br>Could<br>this number be found by theoretical analysis at least<br>for simple games, like Tic-Tac-Toe?<br><br>Joao Neto</div>
