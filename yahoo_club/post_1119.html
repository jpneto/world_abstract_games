    <div>For gambling games such as Backgammon which have already have a random<br>element, yes, the doubling cube makes sense.  It provides a way of<br>"upping the ante". It requires you to analyze your chance of winning<br>and your expected return which kind of goes along with what you're<br>already doing.  You might adjust your strategy to be bolder or more<br>conservative based on your estimated chance of winning, even without a<br>doubling cube.  A doubling cube just adds more of the same type of<br>evaluation.<br><br>For an abstract game, no, I don't like the idea of a doubling cube. <br>Here a doubling cube would have more of a fouling, confounding effect<br>than an enhancing effect.  Now you're burdened with this requirement<br>to analyze your chance of winning the game and how a double would<br>impact your chance of winning the tournament.  <br><br>Your attention is divided.  You're no longer playing the original<br>abstract game.  You're playing a combination of two games: the<br>abstract game and a game of statistical analysis of expected return. <br>For example in certain situations you might be forced to play more<br>wildly than you normally would without the pressure of being doubled.<br> You're diluting and bastardizing the original game by adding a<br>gambling component.<br><br>If someone were to propose using a doubling cube in an abstract game<br>we were playing, my response would be "Tell you what.  Put the cube<br>back in your Backgammon set, and let's just play and see who wins."<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Rich Hutnik" <docreason@...> wrote:<br>><br>> I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon<br>> style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.<br>> <br>> The idea:<br>> 1.
