    <div>Thank you,<br><br>I would like to hear more.  Are there entry levels or is there an open<br>field?<br><br>I have begun to understand your chess variant.  I need to find<br>size-appropriate pieces to give it a whirl.  In that Time Vector's fourth<br>dimension is cyclical, should the White King's men and the Black King's men<br>move from adjacent quadrants in opposite (one clockwise--one<br>counterclockwise) directions kind of like backgammon?  Shouldn't there be a<br>sort of barrier between two quadrants defining the beginning and end of 4D<br>space and giving enough field between?  This would make it easier to tell<br>where each King's control areas are defined than in a linear space, as well.<br><br>Then the problem of finding another Vulcan to play the game with out here...<br><br> -----Original Message-----<br>From: interrupt27 [mailto:no_reply@yahoogroups.com]<br>Sent: Saturday, March 09, 2002 3:52 AM<br>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] An idea for the GRYB playing field<br><br><br>  It occurred to me that the GRYB playing field would make an<br>  interesting Go game.<br><br>  Taking that the liberties would be considered as those nodes which<br>  are adjacent.
