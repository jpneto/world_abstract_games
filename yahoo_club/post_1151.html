    <div>Not sure about Kriegapiel,  but Backgammon is not on my list. Way to <br>reliant on dice roll luck<br><br>If you have to roll to play, it isn't an AS game. They are supposed <br>to be mind to mind, not luck based with dice or draw of a card<br><br>Calvin<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>><br>> As part of IAGO, I was looking to define what would or would not be<br>> represented by by the organization.  I have had heavy argument that<br>> kriegspiel and backgammon need to be excluded, but I would beg to<br>> differ.  Anyone else have any comments regarding this?  What are <br>your<br>> thoughts?<br>></div>
