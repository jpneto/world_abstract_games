    <div>Hello all...i need advice about Origins Game Expo in June.<br><br>Some of you MAY have seen a couple of my games or visited my site;<br>www.acorngames.net before and have seen some of my modest games. I am<br>lucky because i get to sell a few hundred of my games per year at a<br>few small events, through the internet and at a couple of specialty<br>game stores.<br><br>The game on my website, "Pillage & PLunder: The Viking Longship Game"<br>is the game in question today. I have posted an album in the photo<br>section here so you can take a look at it and offer opinions. There<br>are two pics in the album. One is of my original version and the<br>second is the newer version with a modified ship's prow or "head"<br>which made it easier to mass-produce. Pillage & Plunder comes with a<br>wooden Viking boat, two different sized "viking" brothers. The vikings<br>have pegs which allow the players to position them at different spots<br>on the ship to change the balance point and players take turns placing<br>the "barrels" on the ship until they spill.<br><br>The game is all wood. I produced the whole thing here in my shop and<br>have been able to sell them as fast as I make them but they are quite<br>labor intensive since all the parts have to be cut out, finished and<br>assembled.<br><br>To take it to the next level I had a major wood production company<br>take a look at it and they can give me quantities of my finished<br>components at a good price for an all wood game, produced here in the<br>USA and I have...GULP!...decided to "Take The Plunge" and have them<br>make me a thousand units to start.<br><br>Is this ENOUGH to take to ORIGINS this June?<br><br>In additon to this game I will be bringing about 2 to 3 dozen copies<br>of two or three other games in my line-up that are solid sellers and<br>CAN also be taken to the next level pretty easy if I need to.<br><br>Is Origins more "retail" based than other expos? Can anyone tell me of<br>their experiences there? Do you have to get an Ohio sales tax ID? As a<br>matter of fact, do you have to get a tax ID for every state that has<br>an expo or con?<br><br>Can anyone tell me of someone or some company that will "sell" me or<br>"re-sell" me a couple of UPC codes? Are "authentic" UPC's REALLY<br>needed? I have had a retailer use some type of generic barcode sticker<br>before. It was something that allowed them to add non-UPC items to<br>their inventory to make them scannable.<br><br>Does anyone have any other advice? I am stepping out of my comfort<br>zone. I USED to be happy selling a few hundred games a year and have<br>read the post on here for years about garages filled with dreams and<br>un-sold games. LUCKILY...i KNOW I will sell these because I have never<br>made something I couldnt sell to people and I had a hunch about it two<br>years ago and it was my first game that I went the whole distance for<br>as far as copyrighting all aspects of the game and was lucky enough<br>that they even granted me a copyright on the game pieces as a a 3D<br>sculptural work.<br><br>Well I have droned on for WAY to long and look forward to any input<br>you all may have. Thanks - chriS at Acorn Games<br><br>P.S.- Also please look at my new pure abstract game cube2 and let me<br>know what you think.</div>
