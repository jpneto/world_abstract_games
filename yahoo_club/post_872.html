    <div>Thank you for looking into Byte, Ralf.  I for one am interested to <br>see your results.  There is no need for "true-stacking-games" <br>however since we already have Walter Sandsquish's stacking-games.  <br>If I could make a suggestion, make ammends with Walt and publish <br>your results there.  I will not participate in a group in which you <br>are the owner or moderator.<br><br>Mark<br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>><br>> Hello,<br>> <br>> I did a little bit of research in Byte, the new stacking game <br>invented <br>> by Mark Steere. The results were quite unexpected. I analysed <br>endgames <br>> of eight stones and small boards. The results will help to win <br>endgames <br>> fairly easily and are also useful in the opening and middle game.<br>> <br>> The results will be published in the new group<br>> <br>> http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/true-stacking-games/<br>> <br>> Come and join us,<br>> <br>> Ralph<br>>=</div>
