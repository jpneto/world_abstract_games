    <div>Rec.games.abstract is having a Winter stacking game design contest.  Caution: Rga is an unmoderated barnyard where most people would never dare post, but I wanted potential contestants to at least know about the contest, if only to follow it.  <br><br>  http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/3d7d1849463cb271#<br><br>Basically you have until the first day of Spring to come up with a stacking game, i.e. a game where stacking plays a role.  This would include, for example, Checkers and Akron.  <br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://www.marksteeregames.com</div>
