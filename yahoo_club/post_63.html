    <div>This Go variant is played on a regular Go board<br>with four sides. However, call one particular side the<br>"Life Wall".<br><br>The rules of this game are exactly<br>like regular Go, except for scoring the game. At the<br>end of the game, the only groups of your stones which<br>give you points are those groups containing stones on<br>the Life Wall, or whose territory contains<br>intersections on the Life Wall. If we call these groups "Life<br>groups", then your score is equal to the number of your<br>stones which form Life groups, plus the number of<br>territory points contained in your Life<br>groups.<br><br>Related Variant: make the board "periodic" with respect<br>to the two sides perpendicular to the Life Wall; ie,<br>if the Life Wall is the bottom side, then the left<br>side of the board becomes the vertical line of<br>intersections immediately to the "right" of the right side of<br>the board.<br><br>Motivation: encourage more<br>interaction at the start of the game, and make it pointless<br>to play exact opposite of opponent's moves (symmetry<br>strategy).</div>
