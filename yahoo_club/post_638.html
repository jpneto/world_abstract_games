    <div>> Iqishiqi is an interesting game.  Potentially short, and definitely <br>> difficult to extrapolate positions.  A nice use of neutral pieces, <br>> with that solitary stone acting as both the goal and referee.  <br>> <br>> The rules are not really that difficult to comprehend.  There seems <br>> to be a good number of tactics, such as placing stones to block <br>> your opponent's path.  <br><br>Yes, and when the number of pieces are increasing, the game is a <br>reminiscent of football with an increasingly crowded field. :-)<br><br>This game is like building an elaborate maze of shared stones and <br>trying to move the neutral stone into a dead-end, or making the <br>adversaries push the neutral stone near one of your edges, where you <br>might score a "goal" by landing it right on the edge.<br><br>Iqishiqi is also a very nice game for 3 players. Me, Bill Taylor and <br>Cameron played some games like this. In this version, each player <br>only owns two edges, and the game goal is changed like this: <br><br>  "MOVER wins if NEXT cannot make a legal move on his turn. <br>   If the stone reaches a corner owned by MOVER, he wins, <br>   otherwise NEXT wins. Otherwise, if the stone reaches an <br>   edge, the owner of that edge wins."</div>
