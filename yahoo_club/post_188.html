    <div>The rules of 'Games of No Chance' cannot be arbitrarily applied to <br>all abstract games.  It can best be stated that this <br>represents one branch of the tree.<br><br>Although abstract games can be themeless, this does not mean that <br>games with themes are excluded.  If that were the case, the games <br>would not be given decorative titles.  Trax might be <br>called 'Infinite Selective Line/Loop Development'.  Of course, this <br>is not easy on the ears.  A theme allows the players to easily <br>communicate the concept of the game.<br><br>Whether the pieces are called tokens, men or stones is also the <br>prerogative of the developer.  If there are more than one type of <br>piece in the game, it often becomes necessary to give them <br>distinctive names.  This also applies to areas of the playing field.<br><br>There are many ancient games which utilize themes.<br><br>Why must abstract games have only two players?  I see no <br>justification for this assertion.  I know of several which use more <br>than two.  Chinese checkers comes to mind, or is that game not <br>included in the list?<br><br>So, I say to TruthForum, "Lift up your eyes and see the infinite <br>depth that is Abstract Games. Enjoy the various flavors of the <br>banquet."</div>
