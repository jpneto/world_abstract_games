    <div>Hi everyone,<br><br>I've seen some interesting discussions in this group, so I decided to <br>join.  My main interests are in connection-oriented games and shogi <br>variants, but I like a lot of different games.  I've begun work on a <br>website for some games that some of you might find interesting.  The <br>URL is http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/home.htm.  I look forward to <br>being part of the group's discussions.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Steve Meyers</div>
