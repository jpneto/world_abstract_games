    <div>The absolute record of Morpion solitaire is 170. There are 3 records <br>of 170, found by different people. They all date from 1982, and they <br>still stand. (For records the new points should be replaced by <br>numbers. It is then easy to follow the score and check if it is <br>correct.) If the game will ever stop was an open question. Some people <br>from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology picked the game up from <br>my book, and wrote a paper about it. They seem to have proven that the <br>puzzle will stop, which was to be expected. See: <br>http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/papers/Morpion_FUN2004/. Or other <br>pages of Erik Demaine. (I don't understand much about it,since I am <br>not a mathematician). See also: http://euler.free.fr/morpion.htm. Much <br>more is to be said about this puzzle: you can for example free the <br>original 36 points from their arrangement in a cross. Bigger records <br>are then possible.<br>Walter Joris</div>
