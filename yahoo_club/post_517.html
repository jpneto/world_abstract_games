    <div>> That's indeed true. But, nevertheless, Guantanamo Bay somehow <br>reminds me <br>> terribly of Dachau 1935. At this time the Nazi claimed the same as <br>America <br>> does now ("No, no, we don't want to exterminate anybody...). But <br>what will <br>> America do in 20 years? Truly, American policy is shocking. Nobody <br>should <br>> remain silent. If you do, your children will ask you WHY? Who <br>remains <br>> silent, will be guilty. There is a saying: "Oppose the beginnings!"<br>> <br><br>About 700 people are held at Gitmo on suspicion of involvement with <br>al Qaeda and the Taliban.  The U.S. is relying on the notion that <br>they are wartime "enemy combatants" outside the protection of the <br>Geneva Convention because they are not members of a regular army.  <br>This reasoning has also been applied to U.S. citizens, who normally <br>enjoy constitutional protections.  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed <br>yesterday to review the status of these prisoners.  I share your <br>concern that people are being held indefinitely without rights of <br>due process.  It still isn't Dachau, though, even in 1935, and <br>obscuring the differences doesn't help your argument. <br><br><br>> At this forum I said enough. From now on I will only post game <br>related stuff <br>> again.<br>> <br><br>At last we are agreed!</div>
