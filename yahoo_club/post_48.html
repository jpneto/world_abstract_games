    <div>I'll look for the R. Axelrod, "The Complexity of<br>Cooperation" book.<br><br>I've been enjoying lunch-time games<br>with my co-workers, where we usually play 4- or<br>5-player Pente (if you've only played 2-player Pente, you<br>really have no idea what multi-player Pente is like --<br>it's a completely different game).<br><br>We've been<br>playing once or twice a week for about eight months now,<br>and we have evolved strategies unlike those used when<br>we first started playing.<br><br>In fact, we're<br>still seeing games develop in ways unlike any game<br>we've played before. We went through a period where<br>everyone played really close together, one where everyone<br>was trying to get an open three off to the side, and<br>this week we had a game where everyone's first ten<br>moves were played on just the even intersections,<br>spreading out from the center.<br><br>I implemented<br>multi-player Pente (get Go-Moku9.zrf from the Zillions site),<br>but the Zillions computer opponents fail utterly to<br>generate any of the multi-player strategies I see among<br>human players. Sigh.</div>
