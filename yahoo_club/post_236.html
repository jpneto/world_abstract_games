    <div>> I haven't played the game but I think the problem you are <br>identifying <br>> is related to the custodian-capture nature of the game.  <br><br>Sorry, but you are totally missing the problem. The draw is simply <br>related to the early creation of a safe position, that is, a position <br>in which no piece can be captured and one piece can freely move back <br>and forth. This is the same mechanism as in Halma (whether played <br>with Wayne Schmittberger's rule change or not, doesn't matter) and in <br>Halma you don't capture at all. The same can happen (theoretically)in <br>games in which you capture by leaping over opponent's pieces. It is <br>(theoretically) possible in all games in which <br><br>1. you don't capture by replacement (or not at all) <br>2. pieces are permitted to move from one board position to another<br>3. pieces may move to the side and/or backwards <br>4. capturing isn't compulsory<br><br>> Perhaps two moves per turn, <br>> capture by interposition, or allowing the board edge to count as a <br>> custodian would help.  Some of these ideas are incorporated into <br>> Cleave (by Chris Huntoon), which is available at ZoG and appears <br>> reasonably non-drawish.<br><br>Again you miss the point and that's the reason that you come to these <br>strange conclusions. The initial position of Cleave is already a draw <br>and, to say it frankly, the most primitive which can be imagined. You <br>could even offer a draw before you make your first move!!! The game <br>is an embarrassing flaw. <br>The pieces on the third row form a perfect wall and behind this wall <br>you have 8 pieces which can freely move forwards and backwards and <br>forwards such as a1-a2-a1-a2-a1 ..., back and forth eternally. The <br>opponent can never capture even one piece. <br>The game would perhaps work if you would be allowed to capture <br>diagonally, but the rules published on the internet clearly state, <br>that everything is done orthogonally: moving, capturing by <br>custodianship, capturing by intervention.<br><br>Phalanx is not another name for Epaminondas, but the term for the <br>special way of moving around in Epaminondas and in clones such as <br>Freeling's Bushka.<br><br>TruthForum</div>
