    <div>A bell is a cup until it is struck. <br><br>Or for a more direct analogy saying the rules are the game is like saying the blueprints are the house. <br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "GregS" <gschmidt@...> wrote:<br>><br>> Just a semi-philosophical thought...<br>> There is a saying:<br>> <br>> "The map is not the territory"<br>> <br>> For abstract games, I wonder if the converse is true, ie. "The map *is* the territory".  The description of a game *is* the game.  In other words, a rulesheet describing the complete rules of the game does, in fact, constitute the game.  Is a game really nothing more than information?<br>> <br>> Thoughts?<br>></div>
