In the scenario you described, the game is still wide open.  Any one of the three players could still claim all four corners, simply by forming an X.  Just for laughs, let's say the stones don't have to be on the board in equal proportion.  Scenario 1: Drop a yellow stone in the middle, leaving the red and green stones as you described, and let the yellow group grow outward and fill up the board.  Yellow wins 4-0-0.  Scenario 2: Leave one yellow stone in the center and the red and green stones as described and let the green grow out and fill up the board.  Green wins 4-0-0.  Same for Red.<br><br>Any other possibilities are covered by the 2-1-1 and 0-2-2 scores.<br><br>> <br>> I you're probably correct, but it will take more than a handwave<br>> to convince me.<br>><br><br>If you really think about it...</div>
