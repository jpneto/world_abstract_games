    <div>--- In abstractgames@y..., "truthforum2001" <Peace_Panther@h...> <br>wrote:<br>> > What in the world is strange about these conclusions?  <br>> <br>> It is strange that you didn't discover that Cleave is a childish <br>> draw. <br><br><br>I think we are talking past one another.  I was referring to the <br>possibility that certain rule changes might remedy the drawish nature <br>of custodian-capture games, a category in which I include Phalanx.  I <br>have in mind the various attempts to reconstruct Latrunculi.  If you <br>take the "pure" approach without a King/Eagle and allow only <br>traditional custodian capture -- no use of board edges, no line <br>captures, etc. -- the game is not winnable.  In this case it's an <br>endgame problem.  Cleave interests me because it mixes intervention <br>and edge custody with regular custodian capture in a way that <br>addresses the problem. <br><br>>Why did you not discover it? I think, because you look into the <br>> wrong direction. You look at the endgame, but it is far more <br>> important to try to kill a game in the opening. <br><br><br>That's true.  I find the problem you are focused on to be superficial <br>in many cases.  If Phalanx or Cleave can be salvaged by a different <br>initial array and otherwise play well, I see no reason to dismiss <br>them.  If, on the other hand, they degenerate into stalemate <br>regardless of starting positions because capture is too difficult, <br>then fixing them becomes more difficult. <br><br><br>> It is strange that so <br>> many people such as Chris Huntoon and Christian Freeling invent <br>> games, which are an early draw. <br><br><br>We'll have to demand a refund!  ;-)  <br><br><br>> I think there was a predececcor to Epaminondas played on a smaller <br>> board which was (perhaps) called "Phalanx". It is described in Sid <br>> Sackson's book: "A Gamut of Games.", but I don't have the book at <br>> hand right now and here.<br><br><br>That was Crossings.  I think Parlett was confused.  Abbott has <br>suggested going back to the Crossings name since Epaminondas is <br>pretentious and hard to remember.  Having invested so much time <br>learning to spell Epaminondas I wouldn't want to see the name changed <br>now!</div>
