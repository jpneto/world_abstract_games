    <div>I tried posting this before, but the server hung<br>up...<br>I dunno what DAO is, but I looked up the rules to<br>Susan and<br>Abalone on Richard's PBeM server at<br>www.gamerz.net<br>By those rules, the board for each game is the same<br>hexagonal<br>grid of 61 cells. In lieu of scratching out this board<br>in the<br>dirt, maybe you could print the grid out<br>on your piece of paper.<br>After all, if the rules<br>are simple, they can be memorized.<br>Hex has even<br>simpler rules, and the board uses a hexagonal<br>grid,<br>although it's in the shape of a rhombus not a<br>hexagon.<br>Rules to hex are on Richard's server.<br><br>David</div>
