    <div>Hello Joao,<br><br>could you correct the the following mistakes:<br><br>1.<br>>> POLISH CHECKERS<br>>> Like International Checkers but soldiers may also capture backwards<br><br>It's one of the outstanding features of international draughts <br>that "soldiers" (men) may capture backwards. Polish Checkers is <br>identical to International Checkers, except that the game ("Warcaby <br>polski") is sometimes also played on 64 squares. BTW, there is a <br>Polish variant of Hexagonal Draughts ("Warcaby heksagonalne") which <br>perhaps predates Christian Freeling's variant. It was invented in <br>1985 by Jacka Sodowskiego in Szczecina.<br><br>http://www.warcaby.beep.pl/<br>http://www.warcaby.beep.pl/wheksa.html<br><br><br>2.<br>>> SPANISH CHECKERS or POOL CHECKERS<br><br>>> Like International Checkers but played on the English Draughts <br>>> setup. Also, when a soldier is promoted the jump sequence stops.<br><br><br>Spanish Checkers differs from Pool Checkers:<br><br>The double corner is in Spanish Checkers on the left side, while it <br>is in Pool Checkers on the right.<br><br>White starts in Spanish Checkers, while Black starts in Pool Checkers.<br><br>These two differences show that Pool Checkers was influenced by Anglo-<br>American Checker / English Draughts.<br><br>There is the following rule in Spanish Checkers (according to the <br>official rules of the Spanish Checkers Association:)<br>If you can choose among several captures each numbering the same <br>number of enemy pieces, you must play that one which captures more <br>enemy kings. <br><br>Also, your statemtent "like international" checkers is always wrong, <br>as this is based on wrong international rules. Men don't capture <br>backwards in Spanish Checkers, German Checkers, Pool Checkers and so <br>on ... but they do in International Checkers.<br><br>Ralf<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/checkers.htm</div>
