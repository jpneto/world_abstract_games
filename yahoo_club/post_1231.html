    <div>The purpose of the IAR is to come up with a numeric rating for how<br>much a game deviates from a perfect abstract combinatorial game theory<br>game (perfect information, no luck, two players only, no theme).  If a<br>game gets a zero rating, then it would fit this category.  If you can,<br>please provide feedback.  <br><br>Recently IAGO received a very strong venting complaint that it was<br>going WAY off track, and was going to "ruin" the definition of what an<br>abstract strategy game is.  There has been attempts to be able to have<br>standards and processes in place to prevent this, including the IAR. <br><br>But, I would be interested in combinatorial purists to review the IAR<br>to see if it is on-task.  Anyhow, for more information on the IAR,<br>please go here:<br>http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/iar<br><br>Feedback is welcomed and requested.  I will say that the idea of<br>number of pages the rules are isn't great, but short of a more<br>objective measure for a game being weak in theme, it is the only<br>objective measure found.</div>
