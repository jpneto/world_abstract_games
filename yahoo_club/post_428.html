    <div>Jade needs a rule tweak, because as it stands one of the players has <br>a simple winning strategy. I'm consulting with Cameron on the best <br>way to fix it and will post my preferred correction here later. <br>Meanwhile, perhaps our readers would like to work on this as a <br>puzzle: find the winning strategy for Jade.</div>
