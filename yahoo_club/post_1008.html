    <div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Your new game Scribe looks interesting and I donwloaded the rules using the <br>link embedded in your letter. However, when I clicked the pdf for the board <br>I got an error message. I noticed that the second link unintentionally <br>included a period. By manually removing it I succeeded in downloading the <br>board. This version of your link should work a bit better:-<br><br>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_board.pdf<br>.<br><br>Regards<br>David Milne<br><br>What you cannot explain to a five year old will likely change.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>>From: "Mark Steere" <marksteere@...><br>>Reply-To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>>To: abstractgames@yahoogroups.com<br>>Subject: [Abstract Games] Scribe - A Very Unusual Game<br>>Date: Fri, 06 Oct 2006 20:15:35 -0000<br>><br>>Please see http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_rules.pdf for a<br>>write-up of my new game, Scribe.  There's a game board printout at<br>>http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_board.pdf.<br>><br>>Scribe is a very unusual two player game.  It's a departure from my<br>>usual design style, and I expect a departure from anything you've<br>>ever seen.  You need three things to play Scribe: a pen, a blank<br>>sheet of paper (the board is easy enough to draw), and a pretty good<br>>memory.  There are 19 "glyphs" that you must either know or have<br>>handy on a chart.<br>><br>>DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS<br>><br>>There are 512 (2 exp 9) possible permutations of Xs and Os.  In half<br>>of these, X owns less squares than O.  (X,O) = {(0,9),(1,8),(2,7),<br>>(3,6),(4,5)}.  Of those 256 permutations, exactly half are wins for<br>>X and half are wins for O in Scribe.  So if they both play randomly,<br>>they will each have exactly 50% chance of winning.  There will be no<br>>advantage in moving first or second in random play.  I tried to make<br>>the subgroups equitable as well.  For example if X has 3 squares and<br>>O has 6, they both have 42 possible winning permutations.<br>><br>>Not every subset was perfect.  For example if X has zero and O has<br>>9, that's a win for O.  But the discrepancies were negligible.<br>><br>>Though the glyphs may seem arbitrary, they're not.  The 1 square<br>>glyphs and 2 square glyphs could only take one shape.  The 3 and 4<br>>square glyphs were dictated by equitability requirements.  There was<br>>some wiggle room with the larger glyphs, especially the 7 square<br>>glyphs.  But there I chose palatable, recognizable patterns over<br>>awkward, random looking patterns such as the "scrambled eggs"<br>>glyph.  Overall there was very little choice in glyph selection<br>>given the constraints of equitability and aesthetics.<br>><br>>Draws cannot occur in Scribe.<br>><br>>Mark Steere<br>><br>><br>></div>
