    <div>How stupid can you be?   Do you have any evidence to support your <br>interpretation of this game?  Do you think that *any* game with a <br>military theme represents U.S. imperial ambitions?  But at least you <br>are now admitting Iraq has missiles.  ;-)<br><br><br>--- In abstractgames@yahoogroups.com, "Ralf Gering" <br><Peace_Panther@h...> wrote:<br>> February 15, 2003<br>> <br>> Shortly before the war begun, Chris Huntoon's game "Bombardment" <br>was<br>> published by Zillions:<br>> <br>> http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Bombardment.html<br>> <br>> Red and Blue missles fight against each other.
