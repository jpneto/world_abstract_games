F IAG-Blow.<br><br>Hello Mark.  So is this personal disagreement you have with Ralf going<br>to now be ironed out due to a bad decision I made in regards to<br>deleting?  If you and Ralf can iron out your differences, that would<br>be great.   <br><br>The idea was to ask for feedback, which is the reason why.  In<br>retrospect, it should of been proposes as it is currently, as a<br>situation discussing the nature of banning, rather than what had<br>happened.  And in this, it is my fault here.</div>
