    <div>Cage, a variant of Checkers, is omnidirectional, finite, and guaranteed to end with at most one color of checkers on the board.  In other words, about what you'd expect from an MSG Checkers variant.<br><br>Cage rule sheet:<br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cage_rules.html<br><br>Over the years it's occasionally been suggested I try my hand at Checkers design.  The Checkers jump is a magnificent mechanism, but not so magnificent that 500 games need to be built around it. I didn't want to make it 501.  (Is French Checkers really that different from Italian Checkers?  Save some plastic.)<br><br>What better rule to break than your own?  I grudgingly waded into the design of Cage I guess about a month or two ago, and only worked on it once in a while.  Now I'm glad I did because I'm really enthused about Cage.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>Mark Steere Games<br>http://marksteeregames.com</div>
