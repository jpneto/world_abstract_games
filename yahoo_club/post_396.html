    <div>There was a game named "Aera," published by New Dimensions out of <br>Corvallis, OR, and reviewed in GAMES, April/May 1987. The essence of <br>it: each of the two players, Red and Blue, has 6 pieces in his own <br>color, numbered 1 to 6. Moving alternately, they drop them onto the <br>board, in numerical order, onto any vacant square. When the pieces <br>are all placed they alternately move a piece to any vacant square. <br>But the piece they are to move is determined by the numeric sequence. <br>The object is to score points; one point is scored by forming a line <br>of your pieces, either orthogonal or diagonal. The first player to <br>score six points wins.<br><br>Looking for a way to improve Moxie, I devised a game I call "Moxie <br>Plus Plus": The players, White and Red, alternately drop their pawns <br>onto the board. They have 8 pawns offboard at the start. White drops <br>first, but White may not move a Pawn until Red has moved. A Pawn may <br>move any number of squares orthogonally (as a chess rook), but only <br>if at the start of its turn there is a friendly Pawn in the adjacent <br>square either to the North or East (for White) or in the adjacent  <br>square either to the North or West (for Red). If such a move leaves  <br>the Pawn still adjacent to a friendly Pawn in the required direction, <br>the player may continue his turn.  If a move leaves an enemy piece  <br>sandwiched between the moving piece and another friendly piece, the <br>enemy is captured (custodian capture). The object is to form a line <br>of  four friendly pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally. The <br>board "wraps around" for the purpose of moving and for defining a <br>winning line, but not for the purpose of deciding whether a piece has <br>an adjacent friend in the required directions to be allowed to move.</div>
