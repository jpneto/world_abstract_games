    <div>What is a Stacking Game?<br><br>There are many games in which pieces are put on each other or which have pieces on the same board position. <br><br>Promotion is usually expressed in Draughts by putting two unpromoted pieces on each other. However, you could express promotion also by turning a piece upside down, if the bottom is marked differently, or by putting two Draughts men side by side on the same square if it is large enough. Therefore, stacking isn't an essential feature of Draughts. "Kings" should be called "pseudo-stacks". They pretend to be stacks, but in fact they are not.<br><br>You can play every Chess variant including FIDE Chess just by ascribing each piece a stack of a defined height, thus turning Chess into a "stacking game".In fact, however, the nature of these games wouldn't change, thus proving that these chess games should rather be called "pseudo-stacking games". There are many pseudo-stacking games, e.g. all Mancala variants (except Rondell), Backgammon, but also Abstract Chess (Joao Neto), UnStack (Joao Neto) and Tower of Power (Mike Baldwin). In all these games it doesn't matter whether the pieces are stacked or put side by side in an arbitrary way on the same board square. <br><br>Furthermore, a three-dimensional game (no matter if the third dimension is real or not), doesn't make automatically a "stacking game": Akron, P=FCnt, Sogo, Columns and Four wins are not stacking games. Each stack is an autonomous unit, whereas the pieces in the mentioned games form a board-wide lattice.<br><br>Transportation games (e.g. Shoo, Avante) are not either stacking games because those pieces which are sharing the same place are distinguished by their shape, not by their position within a stack.<br><br>Stacking Games should be defined mathematically.<br><br> <br><br>Definition<br><br>A "Stacking Game" is a game which can have >1 pieces at the same place that have different functions depending on their position, thus forming a "functional stack". Each functional stack is an independent one-dimensional unit (bottom - top).<br><br> <br><br>Examples   <br><br>Avalam Bitaka, Bashni, Byte, Dvonn, Emergo, Focus, Lasca, Pasta, Rondell, Stapeldammen, Tricolor.<br><br> <br><br>R.
