    <div>Hi Clark,<br><br>> What size grid have you found to make Jade the most interesting?<br><br>I haven't tried it except on the 11x11, which is the standard size in <br>the new Richard's PBeM implementation. In my closet I have a wooden <br>11x11 Hex board that I made from a cutting-board, and one of these <br>days I'll get around to finishing it. (Er, varnishing it.) If I don't <br>forget I'll bring it in November.<br><br>(BTW, everyone, Jade is now implemented on Richard's Play-by-eMail <br>server, thanks to Cameron Browne.<br><br>jade challenge markthomps yourid<br>jade challenge yourid markthomps<br><br>or<br><br>jade challenge camb yourid<br>jade challenge yourid camb<br><br>... at least, I think Cameron is still taking challenges. He has <br>about eight games going right now.)<br><br>Also, while I'm writing, I should mention that in the summer of 2001 <br>when I first wrote about Jade in this spot, I proposed that each <br>player play BOTH a White and Black stone each turn. It was Claude <br>Chaunier who then suggested the current rule, which is that each <br>player may play EITHER a White or Black stone each turn. Claude's <br>rule is the one I remembered when I recently dredged it up from <br>memory and wrote to Cameron about it, and I now think it makes more <br>sense.<br><br>Mark Thompson</div>
