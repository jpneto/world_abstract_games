    <div>Thanks for the pointer to Gomullo --- I'm going to try it out.<br><br>Steve<br><br>----- Original Message ----- <br>From: "Ralf" <Peace_Panther@...><br>To: <abstractgames@yahoogroups.com><br>Sent: Thursday, March 10, 2005 2:41 PM<br>Subject: [Abstract Games] Connection Games: Variations on a Theme<br><br><br>><br>> This new book written by Cameron Browne is absolutely a must for<br>> anybody interested in abstract strategy games. 402 pages are<br>> providing complete rules for over 200 connection games and variants<br>> including several games of territory in which connections play an<br>> important role (e.g. Go, Tanbo, Anchor, Orbit, Blokus). It is,<br>> indeed, a "comprehensive study of the connection game genre",<br>> although a few connection games are not included, such as the three-<br>> dimensional game of "Blox" (Daniel LaLiberte, 1994) "Gomullo" (Roland<br>> Johansson, 1999), which has the object to make the shortest<br>> orthogonal connection between two opposite board edges that is<br>> possible (ie a row), and "Connections" (Tom McNamara, 1972), a<br>> variant of Bridg-It (not the same game as erroneously stated on page<br>> 160), but much deeper and, in fact, one of the most successful<br>> connection games ever marketed. On the other hand the book describes<br>> many games I didn't know and it will probably take me years until I<br>> tried all of them.<br>><br>> A very good book!<br>><br>> Ralf Gering<br>><br>><br>><br>> http://www.hypernews.org/HyperNews/get/Blox.html<br>> http://othello.dk/book/index.php?title=Gomullo<br>> http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~joe/connections/<br>> http://www.abstractstrategy.com/connections.html<br>> http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/txt/C/Connecti.html<br>> http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3370<br>><br>><br>> Cameron Browne.
