    <div>The "typo" has now been corrected.<br>  <br>  http://www.marksteeregames.com/420_rules.pdf<br><br>Originally I had called the game "X".  The object was to get the "maximum unique" number of corners:<br><br>4-0-0  4 wins<br>3-1-0  3 wins<br>2-1-1  2 wins<br>0-2-2  0 wins<br><br>Later I convinced myself that the 3-1-0 score couldn't happen, and I simplified the objective to obtaining a "unique" number of corners.  Now that Dave Dyer has corrected my error, I've taken the design back to where it was in the first place - sort of.  It's now the "minimum unique" number of corners.  I've grown attached to the name 420 and I didn't want to spoil it by making 3 a possible winning number.<br><br>Minumum unique:<br><br>0-1-3  0 wins<br>0-2-2  0 wins<br>2-1-1  2 wins<br>4-0-0  4 wins<br><br>Thanks again Dave.<br><br>-Mark</div>
