    <div>This is a follow up post to my prior "Unsticking Chess" one. To the<br>end, the purpose of the project is to come up with perhaps a bit of<br>standardization in names, terminology, equipment look and feel,<br>equipment needed, classification/taxonomy, and so on, relating to<br>chess and its variants. These standards would act as a community<br>agreed to consensus, to provide a base upon which people can be able<br>to more effectively communicate with one another, and be able to share<br>their experience. It is not meant to impose restrictive rules, but<br>provide a way to pragmatically facilitate change. A possible end<br>result could be a development path chess can take, that would involve<br>variants in a more relevant way, and enable variants to be taken more<br>seriously, not just as some gimmick, but something that can contribute<br>to the discussion.<br><br>If this project seems irrelevant to you, and you question why it would<br>be needed, then it wouldn't be for you. But I am putting it out there<br>for people to consider, and of interest, to say yes to, and get<br>involved. I personally believe the whole thing should be treated in<br>an open-source manner, where what is developed from this is usable by<br>the community, but also has a way for people to plug their own<br>proprietary creations, and they lend to the conversation, without them<br>losing the rights to them. For example, say the Omega Chess people<br>would want to get their pieces into the conversation. They would<br>still retain the rights, and the project would have a way to<br>accomodate their pieces and rules into the conversation.<br><br>If this is of interest, please say so. Also, please pop into this<br>thread on the Chess Variants wiki and sign in:<br>http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/forum/t-51667/chess-of-tomorrow-project-who-is-interested<br><br>Thank you for your time...<br>- Rich=</div>
