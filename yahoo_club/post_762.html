It's not about colors, it's about <br>numbers. You give the wrong numbers. You have changed the rules, not just <br>the appearance.<br><br>Ralf<br><br><br><br><br><br>>As I mentioned in a previous post here, I'm just concerned with the<br>>game specification, not the look, history, colors of the original<br>>gameset. Sometimes, I read about a game that does use more material,<br>>but can be translated to fit the previous criteria. Foxy is one of<br>>those, but there are others. Of course, errors may appear in the<br>>translation process, and for those, I'm sorry.<br>><br>>Cheers, Joï¿½o Neto<br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>>Yahoo!
