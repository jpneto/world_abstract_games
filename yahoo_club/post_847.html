I suppose it could be played as a<br>turn-based game, but I'm not sure how well it would work.

Leistiko, 2003)<br>Moscow Ice (Kendall Johns, 2004)<br>E, the Game of Martian Chinese Checkers (Carol Townsend, 2004)<br><br>These games (and more) can be found either through S.L.I.C.K. or the<br>Ice Game Design Competition:<br><br>http://www.icehousegames.com/SLICK.html<br>http://www.icehousegames.com/contest/<br><br><br>Outside the world of Icehouse games, Bruno Faidutti invented a simple<br>stacking game called Pilade in 1993, which was published as Babylone<br>in 2003.  Bruno's page about this game mentions one other stacking<br>game not on your list: Stapel (CornAi van Moorsel, no date given).<br><br>http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=mesjeux&id=323<br><br><br>Greg Lam designed an abstract strategy game named Rock, Scissors, Paper<br>in 2001.  One kind of piece (paper) can be stacked.<br><br>http://www.pair-of-dice.com/games/rsp.html<br><br><br>--dougo@...</div>
