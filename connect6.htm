<font face="Arial">says the game is from 2003 by Professor I-Chen Wu. I don&#39;t 
doubt that he designed the game as stated, and by his efforts made the game 
quite popular.<br>
<br>
But the fact is, Connect6 is older than 2003.<br>
<br>
I played the game several times, with Bill Taylor, in 2002 (and probably 2001). 
We called it &quot;1222 6-in-a-Row&quot; and used a boundless board. Here are the two only 
surviving complete matches I could find (not easy to still keep emails from 23 
years ago...)</font><blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">These matches were suggested, most probably my Bill, but 
the game itself was not a design born from our conversations. For us, back then, 
1222 6-in-a-Row was just a nice gaming practice.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s go back to this 1993
<a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/rec.games.abstract/c/hP_7XXzjyFM/m/lTLh2dSKgjkJ">
post</a> from rec.games.abstract </font></p>

	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Bill Taylor Oct 5, 1993, 3:56:58AM<br>
	<br>
	Most board games have a noticeable advantage to the first player. Just 
	recently<br>
	I mentioned a method of &quot;equalizing the advantage&quot; between the players, (or<br>
	rather removing the advantage), that I had posted about some time earlier.<br>
	<br>
	Karl Heuer replied...<br>
	<br>
	&gt;My own favorite &quot;equalization&quot; technique is<br>
	&gt;to have the first player make one move and thereafter each player gets two<br>
	&gt;moves. This doesn&#39;t apply to all board games, but it seems to work well 
	with<br>
	&gt;Hex, simplified Go-Moku, and even Chess (with appropriate 
	check-restrictions).<br>
	<br>
	Yes, this is a fun system. This is the simplest of the multi-move 
	&quot;transformers&quot;<br>
	that myself and Michael Chisnall posted about, in some newsgroup or other, a<br>
	fair while ago. There are a great many other &quot;transformers&quot;, that can apply 
	to<br>
	almost any board game, such as the &quot;misere&quot; transformer, the &quot;kriegspiel&quot;<br>
	transformer, and so on.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">And, Karl Heuer, in the day after:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;The trouble with the 1-2-2-2-2-... 
	multimove transformer, is that<br>
	<br>
	&gt;(ii) it doesn&#39;t necessarily remove the first-move advantage, though it 
	usually<br>
	&gt; reduces it a lot, (though may somewhat *reverse* it).<br>
	<br>
	I thought it made a pretty good equalizer in practice; seems to me that the<br>
	resulting game will favor the second player about as often as the first.<br>
	Consider 1-2-2-... multimove Hex on a size-n board. Who wins under perfect<br>
	play? (I once conjectured that it was player 1 for odd n and player 2 for<br>
	even n, but this turned out to be wrong.)<br>
	<br>
	Simplified go-moku (symmetric rules; no restrictions on forks or overruns;<br>
	infinite board; winning position is n stones in a row) is a first-player win<br>
	for n=5, and a draw for n=7 (I don&#39;t think n=6 has been solved yet). What<br>
	is known about 1-2-2-... multimove go-moku for various values of n?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">I couldn&#39;t find the earlier Taylor/Chisnall post mentioned 
in the text.<br>
<br>
Probably the game now known as Connect6 is even older than these threads. But, 
with this evidence, the BGG entry should include Taylor and Chisnall (c.1993) as 
game designers of Connect6.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">ยง</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Connect6, as it is, seems quite balanced. There are 3000 
matches played at IgGameCenter with almost equal rate for first and second 
player wins. However Connect6 has too much decisiveness. In AbstractPlay the 
median match length is nine turns (!). A good game should provide opportunity 
for some drama, even moku games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">One way Bill and me tried to balance games was using a 
linear restriction: <i>both stones dropped in the same turn cannot be in the 
same row, line or diagonal</i>. This restricts attacks, and favors a more 
strategic approach. Let&#39;s called it <b>Restricted Connect6</b>. We didn&#39;t 
experiment this particular variant, according to the archives of our games, but 
this restriction is so flexible that it is even possible to play <b>Restricted 
Progressive Gomoku</b> (proposed and tested in October 2004), which would be 
impossible with the regular rules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here&#39;s an example:</font></p>
<blockquote>
