<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some comments from the <a href="http://www.mindsports.net/CompleteGames/Territory/MacBeth.html">author</a>:
<i>Note a peculiar difference with Othello, where a move may capture in no less
than eight directions. Although, or rather because MacBeth is hexagonal, its
directions of capture are along straight lines only - not along diagonals. On
top of that one main direction is excluded for every cell by the nature of the
board. This makes MacBeth somewhat easier to handle: colors do not switch quite
that dramatically.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">[Strategy]<i> The starting point of all
reasoning is obviously the fact that there are six corners with the same same
feature that is makes them so popular in Othello: a man on it cannot be captured
and becomes an anchor to capture along the edges. The fact that corners are
strong makes the adjacent cells weak, so these should be avoided. And so on: the
basic reasoning is the same as in Othello, and 'minimal capture' - capturing as
little as possible during the earlier stages, to reduce the opponent's options -
also seems to apply. The finer points of strategy are admittedly no less of a
mystery to me than those of Othello.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A note concerning the &quot;holes&quot; in
the MacBeth board: what happens is that those cells with
holes cannot be reached using the Othello flipping rules. Bill Taylor, Cameron Browne and me tried a 3-player hexagonal
game of Othello with a regular hex board. To solve that feature, we introduced
an extra rule: when a player cannot capture stones (passes were not allowed), he
plays at the central cell (no captures required for that move) and the game
continues as normally. Using this rule mutator, MacBeth could be played on an
uniform hexagonal board.</font></p>

<i>There are no dates in

The GBG, Translations &amp; Miscellany</a>, so it was in the 1980-1986 period, 
probably the second half because barring Havannah, Emergo and Phalanx I started 
with a lot of chess variants in the first half).</i></font></p>
