	<p align="justify"><i><font face="Arial">Usually I write this section 
	immediately after writing the game, but it's been several weeks since I 
	wrote these rules. With the Sluggy Freelance checkers variants and other 
	checkers variants that I've been working on recently, I've had checkers on 
	my mind a lot lately. I think that the initial idea for Lilypad first came 
	to me while setting up a magnetic checkers / backgammon / chess set for a 
	checkers variant test when I looked at the chess pieces; I figured that 
	there had to be a way to use checkers and chess pieces in the same game. 
	Lilypad is the result.<br>
	<br>
	The banner art and thumbnail for Lilypad were created by Cathleen Heard of 
	Smart Eye Design. Thank you Cathy! Thanks to Ben Gibbs and Sharon for 
	playtesting.<br>
	<br>
	The Lilypad story is just spun from thin air. Starting with Psi Squad, 
	continuing with Lilypad, and for the forseeable future, I'm going to start 
	each game with a Story section. The stories frame the games nicely and make 
	them easier to grasp, I think.<br>
	<br>
	Although I haven't seen this game ever before, it seems so simple to me and 
	uses such readily available pieces that I'd be surprised if someone hasn't 
	thought of it before. If you know of or discover an identical game that 
	predates Lilypad, then please let me know so I can properly acknowledge it. 
	Thanks!<br>
	<br>
	* Oh, by the way... If little sprites dancing on turtles and frogs is too 
	fey for you, then just pretend that you're futuristic gladiators battling on 
	hover drones over a pit of red-hot magma. That should get your testosterone 
	pumping.</font></i></p>
