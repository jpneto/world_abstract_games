	<br>
	to<br>
	<br>
	Here&#39;s a little game-design challenge to anyone who wants to think<br>
	about an interesting problem. I&#39;m not going to pose the problem<br>
	rigorously, because I&#39;m lazy. Nonetheless:<br>
	<br>
	There&#39;s an argument to be made in favor of the idea that an ideal game<br>
	is *not* drawless. The idea is that two perfect players should play<br>
	to a draw in an ideal game, and that any other outcome is both an<br>
	unseemly asymmetry, and a violation of the principle of fairness, to<br>
	be expunged. So, what would draws in an ideal game be like? Perhaps<br>
	an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.<br>
	<br>
	So, my challenge to you is to design such a game.<br>
	<br>
	One approach is to pick a drawn state, based on some set of criteria<br>
	that I can&#39;t quite fathom yet, and then ask yourself, &quot;What game would<br>
	have *this* for its only draw?&quot; Ideally, you&#39;d want there to be only<br>
	one possible game that could sensibly have that state for a draw. But<br>
	there might be better ways of going about it.<br>
	<br>
	I&#39;m curious to see what gameplay would be like for a game with a<br>
	single known drawn. Conservative players might play toward the draw,<br>
	before one breaks away when he sees an opportunity for advantage.<br>
	<br>
	Having a single known draw might increase the clarity in the game,<br>
	because players could use knowledge of the draw as a kind of guide to<br>
	play, as in the &quot;conservative&quot; play example mentioned above. But I<br>
	could be completely wrong.<br>
	<br>
	On the other hand, having a single drawn state may not be a very<br>
	worthy goal. Maybe the real goal should be to have a game where draws<br>
	are possible, but where the draw ratio in actual play achieves a<br>
	theoretical non-zero minimum. Basically, a game where a draw can only<br>
	occur between 2 perfect players, and no one else.<br>
	<br>
	Is it possible to design a game where draws are possible, but nobody<br>
	except perfect players can ever get to it? I suppose it requires that<br>
	nobody but perfect players even be able to imagine a drawn state.<br>
	This seems a ridiculous notion, but sometime the greatest insights can<br>
	come from dwelling on ridiculous notions. You&#39;d need some set of rules<br>
	from which you can prove that draws are possible, but for which you<br>
	can provably only find the draws by being able to search the entire<br>
	game tree.<br>
	<br>
	Also, Bill Taylor, if you read this: I&#39;ve noticed that you sprinkle<br>
	your posts with design challenges. It might be a cool idea to compile<br>
	a list of such challenges and then offer little Erdos prizes for those<br>
	who solve them. Might be a way to stimulate more non-propaganda<br>
	discussion on this forum. I wish there were more traffic here. Is<br>
	there someplace where all the designers go to discuss abstract game<br>
	design?<br>

	<br>
	replying to my own post, you *could* theoretically have a game where<br>
	only perfect players can ever find the drawn position. the drawn<br>
	position would have to be defined as some function of every node and<br>
	connection in the game tree itself. That way, only perfect players<br>
	who know the whole game tree could figure out what the drawn position<br>
	is. But is it possible to design a non-stupid game with this<br>
	property?<br>

	&gt; an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.<br>
	<br>
	Having exactly one drawn state doesn&#39;t really matter. Consider this<br>
	game:<br>
	<br>
	The board is an odd number of spaces in a line. A token is placed in<br>
	the middle. Each player starts with N coins. Players alternate paying<br>
	a number of coins to move the token that many spaces in their<br>
	direction. You can pass (only) when you have no coins. The game ends<br>
	when both players have no coins. The winner is the one who has the<br>
	token closest to himself. If it is in the middle, it is a draw.<br>
	<br>
	The game obviously has only one drawn position: The token in the<br>
	middle and both players have 0 coins. But this is the only possible<br>
	outcome of the game, so it is not interesting.<br>
	<br>
	A variant of this is fairly well known and nontrivial: Both players<br>
	secretly bid any number of coins and the winner gets to move the token<br>
	one space in their direction (on a tie the token doesn&#39;t move). Both<br>
	pay their bids. If both bid 0, the game ends. The winner is the one<br>
	who has the token closest to himself. If it is in the middle, it is a<br>
	draw.<br>
	<br>
	Unlike the above, this is not a total-information game, so the notion<br>
	of perfect play doesn&#39;t exist. So we really need to restrict<br>
	ourselces to total-information games,<br>
	<br>
	The interesting properties for a total-information game with draw<br>
	would be:<br>
	<br>
	1. No game can go on forever (there is a maximum number of moves in a<br>
	game).<br>
	<br>
	2. With perfect play, no player can obtain more than a draw.<br>
	<br>
	3. Perfect play is not obvious.<br>
	<br>
	The first is usually fairly easy to decide, the second is well-defined<br>
	but can be hard to prove. For example, Chess is AFAIK still not known<br>
	to lead to a draw with perfect play.<br>
	<br>
	The third property is not well-defined, as &quot;obvious&quot; is a subjective<br>
	property. A reasobable way of defining non-obviousness is<br>
	computational complexity: If the problem of finding an optimal move is<br>
	computationally hard, then it is non-obvious.<br>
	<br>
	Usually, for a game to be computationally hard, there has to be a<br>
	large number of legal (and not obviously bad) moves in each turn and<br>
	the number of turns in a game has to be high. Go is a prime example:<br>
	You have an average of around 100 possible moves per turn (though many<br>
	are obviously bad) and there number of turns is around 100.<br>
	<br>
	Connection games (Hex or similar) can be modified to be like this in<br>
	the following way: There are not enough tokens to fill the board.<br>
	<br>
	While a completely filled board is a win by one side or the other in<br>
	Hex, Y, etc., partially filled boards can be tied (neither side has a<br>
	connection). A plausible Hex variant could be: Use an NxN board,<br>
	where N is odd. Give each player (N^2-1)/2 tokens. This leaves<br>
	exactly one space empty, and both players get the same number of<br>
	moves.<br>

	<br>
	Cool. Another version of the &quot;Hex with draws&quot; idea, which might reduce<br>
	the number of draws further, and perhaps the actual draw ratio, is to<br>
	play hex on a board with an odd number of cells and designate the<br>
	central hex off limits. The central hex is a nice choice because it<br>
	is both the only unique cell on the board, and because filling it<br>
	often gives one an advantage, players would opt away from the draw<br>
	often (assuming that such a game is drawn with perfect play; I don&#39;t<br>
	actually know). Also, then you you wouldn&#39;t have to count out a<br>
	certain number of pieces for each side before the game beings, which<br>
	is more convenient.<br>
	<br>
	The hex variants are good, but they aren&#39;t provably best when it comes<br>
	to minimizing # of draws or draw-ratios, in any way that I can see.<br>
	it would be nice to find games that do.<br>

	&gt; and that any other outcome is both an unseemly asymmetry,<br>
	&gt; and a violation of the principle of fairness, to be expunged.<br>
	<br>
	Indeed so! And in the world of Go, that is very nearly the case.<br>
	Because the game is fine-grained in terms of final outcome,<br>
	(the final score on the board is about as likely to be anything<br>
	between plus and minus 30, between roughly-equal players),<br>
	this leaves scope for...<br>
	<br>
	(a) considerable tinkering with &quot;komi&quot;, (numerical compensation<br>
	for the second-moving player); and<br>
	(b) the opportunity to allow for (fairly rare) draws by means<br>
	of getting the komi &quot;exactly right&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	It is interesting to note that there may be two somewhat<br>
	different komis. One is the &quot;perfect single figure&quot;, known<br>
	only to God, that would make a draw from exactly perfect play;<br>
	and the other is &quot;practical komi&quot; which results in about<br>
	equal numbers of wins and losses for either colour.<br>
	These two figures are almost certainly not the same,<br>
	due to the fallibility of real human players.<br>
	<br>
	Strangely, the Go world seems to go out of its way to AVOID ALL<br>
	possibility of draws, which is odd, and not at all like<br>
	oriental culture in general, where concensus and &quot;market share&quot;<br>
	tend to dominate thinking. It is OC much more like American<br>
	culture, where in commerce and sport, &quot;winner-take-all&quot; views<br>
	tend to dominate, as witness the extreme lengths in baseball,<br>
	basketball and gridiron football to expunge draws.<br>
	<br>
	And yet in Go-scoring ideals it tends to be the other way round!<br>
	Odd. And IMHO an opportunity badly missed. It would be great<br>
	to arrange komi so that it would allow draws infrequently but<br>
	significantly. Indeed, I often think that for amateur players,<br>
	where the scores tend to fluctuate more randomly, it would be<br>
	a great idea to use a &quot;thick komi&quot; that allows a wider interval<br>
	of board-score results to be counted as draws. But this is OT.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; So, what would draws in an ideal game be like?<br>
	<br>
	The above remarks suggest it might be similar to Go-like games,<br>
	that is, games where there is more than just a win/loss outcome,<br>
	but a range of &quot;scored&quot; outcomes. There aren&#39;t many of these,<br>
	but there are some. Games like &quot;Amazons&quot;, where at game end<br>
	the loser has run out of legal moves, but the winner still<br>
	has some (again, say, anything from one to twenty) left over.<br>
	<br>
	So, that would be a start. Alas, there aren&#39;t too many others,<br>
	though perhaps some could be artificially adapted. For example,<br>
	in a connection game, where one player can win so easily that,<br>
	at game&#39;s end, he could claim victory by allowing his opponent<br>
	some number of &quot;free moves&quot;, and still win.<br>
	It&#39;s not much of an idea, but perhaps worth thinking about.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Perhaps an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.<br>
	<br>
	Could be.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; So, my challenge to you is to design such a game.<br>
	<br>
	I&#39;m working on it! No luck yet, however.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I&#39;m curious to see what gameplay would be like for a game with a<br>
	<br>
	&gt; single known draw.Conservative players might play toward the draw,<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&gt; before one breaks away when he sees an opportunity for advantage.<br>
	<br>
	Indeed! I suspect that would be quite common. It could even<br>
	lead to a &quot;chicken&quot;-like element in games, which I have spoken<br>
	of before here. Both players getting closer and closer to<br>
	explosive instability, till one cracks and commits to something.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Having a single known draw might increase the clarity in the game,<br>
	&gt; because players could use knowledge of the draw as a kind of guide<br>
	&gt; to play, as in the &quot;conservative&quot; play example mentioned above.<br>
	&gt; But I could be completely wrong.<br>
	<br>
	No; I think these are all good observations.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Is it possible to design a game where draws are possible,<br>
	&gt; but nobody except perfect players can ever get to it?<br>
	<br>
	That would actually be a good design specification.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I suppose it requires that nobody but perfect players<br>
	&gt; even be able to imagine a drawn state.<br>
	<br>
	Oh no, not at all! It could be very easy for anyone with basic<br>
	game knowledge to *check* that a certain position satisfies<br>
	the (maybe even unique) drawing conditions in the rules; but still<br>
	hugely difficult to actually achieve it. Indeed there are hints<br>
	of NP-not-equal-P-ness to this. (Don&#39;t read that aloud to fast!)<br>
	<br>
	Hard to find but easy to verify. That&#39;s essentially P =/= NP.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Also, Bill Taylor, if you read this:<br>
	<br>
	Hello there Nick! :-)<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that you sprinkle your posts with design challenges.<br>
	<br>
	Well, I&#39;m glad you think so, because it&#39;s a laudable goal.<br>
	But I&#39;m surprised you think so, because I can&#39;t think of<br>
	any particular design challenges I&#39;ve sent out here!<br>
	Please recall and tell us of some, it sounds fun.<br>
	<br>
	I know of many I&#39;ve *worked on*, but mostly they&#39;re kept to<br>
	games that Joao Neto and myself play privately. Some are<br>
	design goals I&#39;ve been very pleased indeed to work on, and<br>
	even pleased-er to have solved! But I don&#39;t recall any on rga.<br>
	<br>
	OC, it&#39;s become a bit dangerous to put out general ideas here,<br>
	because of a certain you-know-who, who shall remain nameless,<br>
	but has a distressing tendency to claim every good idea as<br>
	one of his own, and belittle all those which he can&#39;t! ;-)<br>
	<br>
	So until this poisonous viper changes his ways, or (better)<br>
	just buggers off, your general goal of co-operative construction<br>
	might be unattainable!<br>
	<br>
	&gt; It might be a cool idea to compile a list of such challenges<br>
	<br>
	Well great! But I don&#39;t recall any. Can YOU start a list for us?<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Is there someplace where all the designers go to discuss<br>
	&gt; abstract game design?<br>
	<br>
	THIS is the place! It has been a great place up till recently,<br>
	but now the waters have become poisoned, as happens all too<br>
	often on Usenet, alas. Pity.<br>

	&gt; has some (again, say, anything from one to twenty) left over.<br>
	<br>
	If we&#39;re looking for a &quot;points&quot; game where the spread is typically<br>
	huge (and therefore draws minimized), there is one that I play often<br>
	that fits the criterion well. The rules:<br>
	<br>
	1. board=hexhex<br>
	2. two colors of stones. let&#39;s call them red and blue.<br>
	3. on each turn, player fills a cell with *either* available color<br>
	4. game ends when board is full<br>
	5. player 1 wins if the product of the sizes of the two largest red<br>
	groups is larger than than the same product for blue groups. If there<br>
	is only one group for a color, the final score for that color is<br>
	zero.<br>
	<br>
	Because the final score is a product the scores can and do swing<br>
	wildly. I&#39;ve seen (and participated in) spreads greater than 2000<br>
	points. One of the greatest game experiences of my life came while<br>
	playing this game, when the difference in final scores ended up being<br>
	2, something I&#39;ve not come close to achieving before or since. The<br>
	game obviously works better played online, where the computer tallies<br>
	the score for you.<br>
	<br>
	You can step through the moves in a recently completed game here:<br>
	http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=17&amp;sid=48567&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en<br>
	<br>
	(note in the version that you see there, there are no ties, because<br>
	player 1 wins in the event of an equal score. But if you change it a<br>
	bit so that equal scores are defined as a tie, the game is a good<br>
	example of what we&#39;re looking for). There&#39;s more than one drawn state<br>
	in that game, though, so it&#39;s not really what I&#39;m looking for.<br>
	<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; &gt; I suppose it requires that nobody but perfect players<br>
	&gt; &gt; even be able to imagine a drawn state.<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; Oh no, not at all! It could be very easy for anyone with basic<br>
	&gt; game knowledge to *check* that a certain position satisfies<br>
	&gt; the (maybe even unique) drawing conditions in the rules; but still<br>
	&gt; hugely difficult to actually achieve it. Indeed there are hints<br>
	&gt; of NP-not-equal-P-ness to this. (Don&#39;t read that aloud to fast!)<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; Hard to find but easy to verify. That&#39;s essentially P =/= NP.<br>
	<br>
	ahh yes. That is a helpful analogy. Gives me a new way to think<br>
	about it.<br>
	<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that you sprinkle your posts with design challenges.<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; Well, I&#39;m glad you think so, because it&#39;s a laudable goal.<br>
	&gt; But I&#39;m surprised you think so, because I can&#39;t think of<br>
	&gt; any particular design challenges I&#39;ve sent out here!<br>
	&gt; Please recall and tell us of some, it sounds fun.<br>
	<br>
	One that I remember offhand: a *local* YMMV pattern. I&#39;ve given that<br>
	one some serious thought, without much progress. I don&#39;t have time at<br>
	the moment to go search through the archives for others, but I&#39;m<br>
	pretty sure there are others.<br>
	<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; &gt; It might be a cool idea to compile a list of such challenges<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; Well great! But I don&#39;t recall any. Can YOU start a list for us?<br>
	<br>
	Yes! Maybe not at this very moment, but certainly in the next week or<br>
	so. So now off the top of my head, we have: 1) a local YMMV pattern;<br>
	2) a game with a single drawn state that only perfect players can<br>
	reach; and 3) the &quot;analogue&quot; connection game that you guys are<br>
	discussing in the other thread (about which I have fruitlessly<br>
	wondered on many occasions).<br>
	<br>
	&gt; THIS is the place! It has been a great place up till recently,<br>
	&gt; but now the waters have become poisoned, as happens all too<br>
	&gt; often on Usenet, alas. Pity.<br>
	<br>
	This is not the first forum that&#39;s gone wanky as a result of a-certain-<br>
	someone&#39;s presence. Nor is it the second. There are vivid,<br>
	entertaining accounts of past difficulties across the web, if you want<br>
	a chuckle.<br>

	<br>
	&gt; If we&#39;re looking for a &quot;points&quot; game where the spread is typically<br>
	&gt; huge (and therefore draws minimized), there is one that I play often<br>
	&gt; that fits the criterion well. The rules:<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; 1. board=hexhex<br>
	&gt; 2. two colors of stones. let&#39;s call them red and blue.<br>
	&gt; 3. on each turn, player fills a cell with *either* available color<br>
	&gt; 4. game ends when board is full<br>
	&gt; 5. player 1 wins if the product of the sizes of the two largest red<br>
	&gt; groups is larger than than the same product for blue groups. If there<br>
	&gt; is only one group for a color, the final score for that color is zero.<br>
	<br>
	That&#39;s a rather cool game! And, I suspect, one of the few which<br>
	is actually *better* on a small board than a big one; or rather,<br>
	more skillful anyway. Because on really small boards there<br>
	would be a definite subgoal conflict; where the player tries to<br>
	keep his groups big to score well, but also keep them small enough<br>
	to ensure there are at least two.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, games where the opponent can move or play *your* pieces<br>
	as well as his own are always fun and spritzy. Chameleon is like<br>
	this.<br>
	<br>
	And the genral idea can be modified a little, especially for those who<br>
	object to an overtly arithmetical element. The sum of the sizes of<br>
	the top two is simpler, but still with 0 total score for one group.<br>
	Even cooler with respect to mixed goals:- win with the biggest<br>
	NUMBER of separate groups, with ties going to the biggest single<br>
	group! That would be diabolical.<br>
	<br>
	All of these to be played with the &quot;both can play either&quot; rule.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; This is not the first forum that&#39;s gone wanky as a result of a-certain-<br>
	&gt; someone&#39;s presence. Nor is it the second. There are vivid,<br>
	&gt; entertaining accounts of past difficulties across the web, if you want<br>
	&gt; a chuckle.<br>
	<br>
	Wow. VERY interesting indeed. But a google search doesn&#39;t<br>
	seem to help. Can you tell us what groups to look in, please?<br>
