<p><font size="3" face="Arial">These seems to be the reconstructed rules for
City (a.k.a. Petteia which is a Greek word for board/piece game). But this rule set is prone to a drawish strategy. It is very hard for a
player to gain advantage unless a serious mistake is made. First, a cornered
stone cannot be captured, so it seems that edges should be used for capturing
purposes. Second, something must be done to prevent situations like the one
presented on the second diagram.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There is also the suggestion that stones would
not slide, but just move to adjacent empty cells. <a href="http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-jostenge/samsin.pdf">Myron
Samsin</a> suggests that there is a connection between City soldiers and
chess pawns. Perhaps (I say) this stone movement is even more restricted (only
forward?). That would bring some solutions to the apparent problem of this game.</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Petteia is referred to many times in Greek literature. In
	'The Republic' Plato compares Socrates victims to &quot;bad Petteia players,
who are finally cornered and made unable to move by clever ones.&quot; In the same
works Plato quite clearly tells us that Petteia involves long training if skill
is to be achieved. Aristotle, tutor to Alexander The Great, wrote &quot;a citizen
without a state may be compared to an isolated piece in a game of Petteia&quot;. It
seems quite likely that these &quot;petteia&quot; games spread from ancient Athens to
Persia, Asia Minor and India with the armies of Alexander The Great around 330
BC.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"> The game is very similar to the Egypt game Siga (or <a href="seega.htm">Seega</a>).</font>
<font size="3" face="Arial">After the Greek cultural influence over Ancient Rome
also had its echoes on <a href="latrunculi.htm">Latrunculi</a>. Other related
games can be found <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html">here</a>.
I found on the net also these names of related games: </font><font size="3" face="Arial">Tau,
Pente Grammai, Nard, Shantarad, Fitchneal, Tawlbyund, and <a href="hnefatafl.htm#alea"> Alea
Evangeli</a>, most of which I
do not know...</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some people defend that <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/historic.dir/chaturanga.html">Chaturanga</a>
was combined with City. The result was a game close to modern </font><font size="3" face="Arial">Chess.
The dice were eliminated, and the emphasis of the game shifted from chance to
strategy. On <i>Chess - An Illustrated History</i> (1990) it is said &quot;<i>It is
essentially to Averbakh that I owe the theory of the meeting of Greek Petteia
with Indian dice games along Alexander's route of Hellenic colonization,
producing the earliest form of chess.</i>&quot;</font></p>
